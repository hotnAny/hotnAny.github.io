# Electrical Engineering Basics
* **CMOS**

* **FPGA** (Field Programmable Gate Array) refers to integrated circuits that can be re-configured by the users. For example, a user can configure an FPGA to connect an external LED and switch so that the switch turns on/off the LED; alternatively, the user can re-configure the FPGA to add an NOT-gate in the existing circuit so the switch behaves the opposite way. FPGA differs from a microcontroller in that you write programs that run on a microcontroller, but you write 'programs' that change the actual circuitry in an FPGA

* **Integrated Circuits** (IC)

* **IC packaging** refers to the ways IC components are encapsulated so that they can be protected while being connectable to IC, e.g., a resistor is packaged with pins solderable to a PCB.

* **Semiconductor**

* **Solid-state electronics** concerns itself with the study of electronics that consist entirely of solid materials with electrons or other charge carriers confined entirely within those materials, which contrasts earlier technology based on vaccum or gas-discharge tubes. In other words, with solid-state electronics, current flows through solid matters by means of the movement of electrons. Examples of solid-state electronics include transistors, microprocessor, RAM, solid-state drives, light-emitting diode (LED), liquid-crystal display (LCD), and integrated circuits (IC).
