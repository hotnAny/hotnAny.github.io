I listened to a fair amount of this audio book but unfortunately did not finish it.
Nonetheless, I had two memorable take-away's worth writing down.

First, the academic world was so harsh to the young Einstein.
Even after he published a few very influential papers, Einstein still struggled to find an academic position. The responses and demands from the universities seemed inconsiderate of his achievements where they could have looked at the impact of his papers to easily justify a hiring decision.
Was this what the academic world was like in the early 20th century?
If a genius like Einstein had to endure all this pain to establish himself, imagine what it'd be like for the rest.
Maybe think about it positively instead.
If a genius like Einstein had to endure all this pain to establish himself, what do have to complain about when we struggle in our academic career?

Second, Einstein was not good at teaching.
This echoed a common yet perhaps less known phenomenon that good researchers aren't necessarily good teachers (and vice versa).
Einstein was just another example.
However, there were exceptions. 
Feynman, for instance, was good at both. He was famously known for being able to articulate a hard problem to make it easily understood.
