<!-- 2023-thinking-in-systems -->

This is an unusual book because it not only brings you new knowledge---as other books do---but also attempts to change how you think.
After reading this book, with sufficient depth and absorption, you will be able to look at the same phenomenon but think about it in new light.
For example, heating up a house is not just heater blowing out hot air until the temperature reaches a preset number; instead, you will look at the house as a stock of heat (just like a bathtub is a stock of water): the heater provides inflow and the house's dissipation of heat is the outflow.
This way of looking at heating a house enables some analytical thinking, such as how different ways a thermostat provides feedback might result in suboptimal relationships between inflow and outflow (feedback with latency might cause fluctuation between too cold and too hot).

The language is fairly laymen-friendly but it still require quite some amount of thinking as you read through the rich ideas throughout the book. It takes even more mental effort to really apply the thinking method on your own to some problems.
I have to say I have not been able to apply system thinking in my own work.

## Key Points
On stability vs. resilience
> Static stability is something you can see; it's measured by variation in the condition of a system week by week or year by year. Resilience is something that may be very hard to see, unless you exceed its limits, overwhelm and damage the balancing loops, and the system structure breaks down. ... people often sacrifice resilience for stability, or for productivity, or for some other more immediate recognizable system properly.

On self-organization
> The capacity of a system to make its own structure more complex is called self-organization.

The ubiquity of model
> Everything we think we know about the world is a model. ... None of these is or ever will be the *real* world.

On language limits thoughts
> ... we don't talk about what we see; *we see only what we can talk about*

On interdisciplinary work
> Interdisciplinary communication works only if there is a real problem to be solved, and if the representatives from the various disciplines are more committed to solving the problem than to being academically correct. They will have to go into learning mode. They will have to admit ignorance and be willing to be taught, by each other and by the system.
