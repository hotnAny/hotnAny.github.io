I remember that, in the early 2000’s, it was constantly on the best-seller list in the Chinese Readers’ Digest magazines. Interestingly, I never got a chance to buy or read it until so much later.

This is a very simple yet powerful book about dealing with changes that happen to us.

The main ideas are that we should learn to accept that changes will happen, that we need to anticipate and respond to changes rather than staying where we are, that our changes to address changes might not always work but will liberate and energize us because adapting to changes is a better lifestyle than one that does not.

Although the main idea is not necessarily groundbreaking, it makes this book a best-seller because of the unique way the book conveys this idea to the readers via simple storytelling. Life is modeled as tiny people and mice running in a maze looking for cheese. Changes that happen to us are metaphorically represented as the disappearances of cheese. By describing how the tiny people and mice react differently to the disappearance of cheese, the book makes us reflect on how we deal with changes in our lives—whether we are Hem, Haw, Scurry, or Snuffy.

I believe storytelling goes a long way of making ideas memorable to the readers. Stories are easier to remember than mere preaching of ideas. As readers recall stories, they perform the exercise of interpreting and reflecting the stories in their own context. Simple stories are easier to memorize and make it somewhat easier and more tempting to reflect on one’s own life via stories.
