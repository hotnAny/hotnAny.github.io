I only read Part I so am not well-positioned to comment too much on this classic book on the philosophy of science.

Later I read another book that introduced Popper's work in a chapter, which is much more accessible. I also realized the influences Popper had on many other scientists' work.

Below are just some nuggets from Part I of the book.

A holistic way of motivating a devotion to science, also, explaining what does it mean to conduct scientific discovery.
> ... there is at least one philosophical problem in which all thinking men are interested. It is the problem of cosmology: *the problem of understanding the world--including ourselves, and our knowledge, as part of the world*. All science is cosmology ...

This seems also to question LM's approach of solving problems as language (autoregressing).
> Admittedly, understanding the functions of langauge is an important part of it; but explaining away our problems as merely linguistic 'puzzles' is not

The importance of language in problem solving:
> ... criticism will be fruitful only if we state our problem as clearly as we can and put our solution in a sufficiently definite form---a form in which it can be critically discussed.

On coming up with new ideas:
> ... there is no such thing as a logical method of having new ideas, or a logical reconstruction of this process. ... every discovery contains 'an irrational element', or 'a creative intuition' ...

Four different ways of testing a theory:
> First there is the logical comparison of the conclusions among themselves, by which the internal consistency of the system is tested.
> Secondly, there is the investigation of the logical form of the theory, with the object of determining whether it has the character of an empirical or scientific theory, ... tautological
> Thirdly, there is the comparison with other theories, chiefly, with the aim of determining whether the theory would constitute a scientific advance should it survive our various tests.
> ... finally, there is the testing of the theory by way of empirical applications of the conclusions which can be derived from it.

Instead of "proving" a theory ...
> So long as a theory withstands detailed and severe tests and is not superseded by another theory in the course of scientific progress, we may say that it is 'corroborated'.

> ... the *objectivity* of scientific statements lies in the fact that they can be *inter-subjectively* tested. The word 'subjective' is applied by Kant to our feelings of conviction (of varying degrees).
