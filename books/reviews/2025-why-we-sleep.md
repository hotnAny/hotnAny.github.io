I listened to the audiobook version of this book.

Rich in scientific insights and data, this book’s biggest impact on me was its emphasis on the critical role of sleep. Sleep is deeply intertwined with nearly every aspect of life—health, memory, and cognitive function. While the book doesn’t spend much time on specific sleep-improvement techniques beyond a few key recommendations at the end, its main objective seems to be raising public awareness about the widespread issue of insufficient sleep.

One particularly striking insight was that research suggests drowsy driving can be even more dangerous than drunk driving—something I had suspected from my own experiences but hadn’t seen confirmed by scientific studies until now.

Another key point the book highlights is the flawed logic behind sacrificing sleep for productivity. Many people believe that cutting back on sleep allows them to work more, but in reality, sufficient rest leads to higher-quality work, reducing the overall time needed to complete tasks. Despite this, the idea that "more hours awake equals more output" remains deeply ingrained, making it difficult for people to recognize the cost of sleep deprivation.

While listening to this book, I made a conscious effort to improve my own sleep habits, such as winding down in the evening with melatonin-infused herbal tea. Even though I never struggled with sleep before and generally felt great, I still noticed an improvement in my overall daily experience.

That said, like many audiobooks, this one posed some challenges when it came to absorbing complex scientific content, particularly detailed experimental findings. Listening alone didn’t allow me to fully engage with the deeper scientific aspects in the way that reading might have.
