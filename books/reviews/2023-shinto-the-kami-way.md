Like many people who visited Japan, I was very impressed by how clean the country is and how people keep it that way. Then I read from an article that suggests the cleanness is partially due to the belief in Shinto, that cleaning is considered an activity to keep one's mind pure.

I was so intrigued that I bought this book to learn more about how the philosophy of Shinto can be beneficial to my life. Unfortunately, most of the book is just about Shinto as a religion rather than a generalizable philosophy of life. Nonetheless, I found a few quotes that seem to go beyond religion alone.

> In its general aspects Shinto is more than a religious faith. It is an amalgam of attitudes, ideas, and ways of doing things that through two milleniums and more have become an integral part of the *way* of the Japanese people.

> What is meant by "kami"? Fundamentally, the term is an honorific for noble, sacred spirits, which implies a sense of adoration for their virtues and authority. All beings have such spirits, so in a sense all beings can be called kami or be regarded as potential kami.

> Torii ... entrance to shrines, is marked by one or more *torii*, the gateway which symbolically marks off the mundane world from the world of the kami, the secular from the spiritual.

Finally, although I am not particularly interested in Shinto as a religion, I still appreciate the meticulous efforts put into writing this book, which involved both Japanese and Western scholar working closely together to overcome the language barrier and introducing Shinto to the world.
