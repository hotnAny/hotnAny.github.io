<!-- 2022-existential-physics -->

This is a such a great book because the author takes such a no-nonsense, down-to-earth approach to explain some of the biggest questions physicists try to answer, such as the origin of the universe, whether there is an end, and whether everything that happened or will happen is determined.

I probably will forget most of the physics stuff but I will always remember how the author always level-headedly distinguish what is true vs. what is scientific. Some equate the two but they could be wrong. Claiming that God exists is ascientific because currently we cannot prove it; but that doesn't mean it's untrue. Do multiple universe exist? One might be able to show how it is possible in a scientific way but such a reality might not be true (i.e., doesn't exist).

I appreciate how the author painstakingly repeat some key message, such as her argument that everything in the universe is determined given an initial state and the necessary differential equations. She also repetitively asserts her critical view of how certain theory might be true and/or provable but it's not necessary to explain what we have observed (thus meaningless?)

Overall, one can take away with a negative change of life attitude. Nothing really matters in the grand scheme of the universe. We don't have free will and everything that happened or will happen has already been determined by some models. However, the author does end with a positive note: she believes we owe it to ourselves to explore these big questions about the universe in which we exist, however insignificant our existence might be, which I fully agree. I hope I can get some answers within my lifespan.
