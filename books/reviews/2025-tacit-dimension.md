This is a 3-part lecture notes by the author on the thesis that "we can know more than we can tell" and we cannot expect to explain certain systems or to discover new insights via applying some known rules. 

I think the first part (Tacit Knowing) is the most cohesive, sending very strong and repetitive messages about its thesis; the second and third parts started to lose some focus, perhaps in an attempt to expand the core idea established in Part 1.

## Main Ideas

The shortest version:
> ... we can know more than we can tell

More:

> ... as Michael Polanyi puts it, we can know more than we can tell.

> ... "tacit knowledge" that cannot be easily formalized and put in to exact words has a sweeping presence in the world, and he goes on to argue that it is also a central feature of our knowledge of that world.

> Tacit knowledge is known to account (1) for a valid knowledge of a problem. (2) for the scientist's capacity to pursue it, guided by his sense of approaching his solutions, and (3) for a valid anticipation of the yet indeterminate implications of the discovery arrived at in the end

> ... all thought contains components of which we are subsidiarily aware in the focal content of our thinking, and that all thought dwells in its subsidiaries as if they were parts of our body

## Part 1 - Tacit Knowing

Relationship with Gestalt psychology:
> Gestalt psychology has assumed that perception of a physiognomy takes place through the spontaneous equilibration of its particulars impvressed on the retina or on the brain. However, I am looking at Gestalt, on the contrary, as the outcome of an active shaping of experience performed in the pursuit of knowledge

Language is "a kind of verbal pointing" at information that becomes assimilated into the listeners' tacit knowledge.

In experiments where participants learned to associate being shocked with the recognition of specific symbols:
> ... the two terms of tacit knowing. In the experiment the shock syllables and shock associations formed the first term, and the electric shock which followed them was the second term.

> ... we know the first term only by relying on our awareness of it for attending to the second.

Proximal & distal terms:
> In the exercise of a skill, we are aware of its several muscular moves in terms of the performance to which ou r attention is directed. ... in general, that we are aware of the proximal term of an act of tacit knowing in the appearance of its distal term.

How tacit knowing is related to theory
> To interiorize is to identify ourselves with the teachings in question, by making them function as the proximal term of a tacit moral knowledge, as applied in practice. ... To rely on a theory for understanding nature is to interiorize it. For we are attending from the theory to things seen in its light, and are aware of the theory

Another explanation of tacit knowing:
> ... wherever some process in our body gives rise to consciousness in us, our tacit knowing of the process will make sense of it in terms of an experience to which we are attending.

Tacit knowing of our body:
> Our own body is the only thing in the world which we normally never experience as an object, but experience always in terms of the world to which we are attending from our body.

Benefits of tending to tacitness
> ... the dwelling of particulars, which by itself would destroy meaning, serves as a guide to their subsequent integration and thus establishes a more secure and more accurate meaning of them.

## Part 2 - Emergence

This is more like a recap of Part 1:
> ... (1) Tacit knowing of a coherent entity relies on our awareness of the particulars of the entity for attending to it; and (2) if we switch our attention to the particulars, this function of the particulars is canceled and we lose sight of the entity to which we had attended.

Also applicable in the AI era---we cannot expect to fully understand how AI/machine behaves by applying laws to understand its structure and components:
> ... machines have a purposive character which cannot be derived from the laws of physics and chemistry

Natural laws are constraints rather than enabler of a machines' working principles:
> These principles may be said to govern the boundary conditions of an inanimate system---a set of conditions that is explicitly left undetermined by the laws of nature.

## Part 3 - A Society of Explorers

Nice recap of previous texts
> My first lecture dealt with our power of tacit knowing. It showed that tacit knowing achieves comprehension by indwelling, and that all knowledge consists of or is rooted in such acts of comprehension. The second lecture showed how the structure of tacit knowing determines the structure of comprehensive entities. By studying the way tacit knowing comprehends human performances, we saw that what is comprehended has the same structure as the act that comprehends it. The relation of a comprehensive entity to its particulars was then seen to be the relation between two levels of reality, the higher one controlling the marginal conditions left indeterminate by the principles governing the lower one. Such levels were then stacked on top of each other to form a hierarchy, and this stacking opened up the panorama of stratified living beings. This stratification offered a framework for defining emergence as the action which produces the next higher level, first from the inanimate to the living  and the from each biotic level to the one above it. This holds both for the development of an individual and for the evolution of living things.

Connecting tacit knowing to discovery:
> Indeed, the process by which it will be brought to light will be acknowledged as a discovery precisely because it could not have been achieved by any persistence in applying explicit rules to given facts. The true discoverer will be acclaimed for the daring feat of his imagination, which crossed uncharted seas of possible thought.
