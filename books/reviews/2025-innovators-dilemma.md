Overall, this book tries to answer the question: why would a company do everything right (management, marketing, operation, etc.), yet still inevitably lose the war to new and disruptive technologies?

### Sustaining vs. disruptive technologies
- Sustaining technologies "forster improved product performance" and "improve the performance of established products". Competitors with sustaining technologies are unlikely to beat leading companies.
- Disruptive technologies "underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally, new) customers value.

### Why companies should sometimes go against good principles
> ... many of what are now widely accepted principles of good management are, in fact, only situationally appropriate. There are times at which it is right *not* to listen to customers, right to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise *lower* margines, and right to aggressively pursue small, rather than substantial, markets.

### Organizations' processes and values:
> An organization's capabilities reside in two places. The first is in its processes--the methods by which people have learned to transform inputs of labor, energy, materials, information, cash, and technology into outputs of higher value. The second is in the organization's values, which are the criteria that maangers and employees in the organization use when making prioritization decisions.

> The very processes and values that constitute an organization's capabilities in one context, define its *dis*abilities in another context

### Key take-away points
Market's changing demands and innovative progress are often out of sync:
> ... the pace of progress that markets demand or can absorb may be different from the progress offered by technology. This means that products that do not appear to be useful to our customers today (that is, disruptive technologies) may squarely address their needs tomorrow.

Resources allocation is key to supporting innovation:
> ... managers will find it extraordinarily difficult to keep resources focused on the pursuit of a disruptive technology.

Current customers' needs are at odds with innovation:
> ... stretches or forces a disruptive technology to fit the needs of current, mainstream customers ... is almost sure to fail

The "secrete sauce" of successful companies might be very context-specific:
> capabilities of most organizations are far more specialized and context-specific than most managers are included to believe.  ... organizations have capabilities to take certain new technologies into certain markets ... have disabilities in taking technology to market in other ways

Companies cannot expect to find or wait for the innovation formula to arrive without trials and errors:
> ... information required to make large and decisive investments in the face of disruptive technology simply does not exist. It needs to be created through fast, inexpensive, and flexible forays into the market and the product.

> Successful organizations, which ought not and cannot tolerate failure in sustaining innovations, find it difficult simultaneously to tolerate failure in disruptive ones.

Who first get into a disruptive technology has the first-mover advantage:
> Disruptive innovations entail significant first-mover advantages: Leadership is important.

> ... disruptive technologies rarely make sense during the years when investing in them is most important, conventional managerial wisdom at established firms constitutes and an entry and mobility barrier ...
