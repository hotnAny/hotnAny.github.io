Overall, this book tries to answer the question: why would a company do everything right (management, marketing, operation, etc.), yet still inevitably lose the war to new and disruptive technologies?

### Sustaining vs. disruptive technologies
- Sustaining technologies "forster improved product performance" and "improve the performance of established products". Competitors with sustaining technologies are unlikely to beat leading companies.
- Disruptive technologies "underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally, new) customers value.
