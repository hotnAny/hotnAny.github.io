The author believes insulin resistance--"less and less responsive to the hormone's effects"---causes a wide range of health-related issues.

A few things I changed or am planning to implement after reading the book:
- I drink two spoon-ful of apple cider vinegar with water every morning;
- I try avoid eating fruits other than berries because they contain little sugar;
- Try to eat fermented food (e.g., kimchi) whenever possible;
- "... eating the starchy part of the meal after the protein and vegetables had a significant smaller effect on blood glucose and insulin."

Some background/nuggets (excerpts from the book):

> Insulin's most famous role is regulating our blood glucose levels. When we eat food that increases blood glucose, the pancreas releases insulin, which then "opens the doors" to escort glucose from the blood to various parts of the body, such as the brain, heart, muscles, and fat tissue.

> ... type I diabetes is caused by having too little insulin (or none), type 2 is caused by having too much (insulin resistance)

> A useful tool in deciding whether a carbohydrate is "good" or "bad" is by determining its glycemic load, or GL--a number that estimates how much a particular carbohydrate food will raise your blood glucose after you eat it.
