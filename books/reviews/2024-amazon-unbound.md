I listened to the audio book version after going through a long list of other options that are either uninteresting or too interesting to listen (meaning I should instead read them).

I was hoping this one could be another [Elon Musk](https://hci.prof/books/#2024-elon-musk) even though the author is no Walter Isaacson.

It wasn't quite like that ...

This book---a sequel of the same author's previous autobiography of Bezos---feels more like a chronological laundry list of recent affairs between Bezos and Amazon. In contrast, Isaacson's depiction of Musk, though based on interviews with him to ensure factualness, often carries subtle hints of opinion that brings readers' attention to certain characters of Musk, such as his tendency to question authority and the relentless spirit of getting to the bottom of things. In this Bezos book, I think there need to be more of the author's interpretation of who Bezos is.

Nonetheless, I still learn something from this book, vis-a-vis the Musk book.
Both Bezos and Musk tend to question assumptions especially during meetings because employees are often constrained by certain assumptions that they are unaware of. 
As an effective manager, you've got to develop a habit of just questioning these assumptions because maybe some of the assumptions are untrue and you would help employees discover opportunities that otherwise would have been missed.
