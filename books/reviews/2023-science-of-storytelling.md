<!-- 2023-science-of-storytelling -->

This is a book mostly for creative writing, a systematic discussion about elements that make a good story. The main, rough take-away:
* a good story starts with changes;
* a good story is not just about a good setting; it's fundamentally about the character(s);
* the core of a character in storytelling is 'sacred flaws'---how a character is flawed in a way that violates what many others think is sacred;

Although storytelling is universal, as the book motivates itself by, what this book is concerned with seems too narrow to apply broadly. For example, it'd be hard for a biologist to learn from this book how to tell a good story of their research when giving a public talk.

Still, an interesting book (to skim).

On how storytelling shapes how we accept/reject facts
> ... if we're psychologically healthy, our brain makes us feel as if we're the moral heroes at the center of the unfolding plots of our lives. Any 'facts' it comes across tend to be subordinate to that story. If these 'facts' flatter our heroic sense of ourselves, we're likely to credulously accept them, no matter how smart we think we are. If they don't, our minds will tend to find some crafty way of rejecting them.

On how to open a story.
> Many stories begin with a moment of unexpected change.

* This might be something one can apply when writing a paper---motivating or hinting a change, e.g., "Keyword-based search engine is yesterday; the future of search is chat."

On the protagonist's flaw.
> At the start of a story, we'll often meet a protagonist who is flawed in some closely defined way. The mistakes they're making about the world will help us empathise with them. As the story gives us hints and clues about the causes of their errors, we'll warm to their vulnerability and become emotionally engaged in their struggle. When the dramatic events of the plot coa them to change we'll root for them.

On the central question to a story.
> If there's a single secret to storytelling then I believe it's this. *Who is this person?* Or, from the perspective of the character, *Who am I?* It's the definition of drama. It is its electricity, its heartbeat, its fire.
