This is a book about the philosophy of parenting (and, in general, how to mentor or coach other people).

The author is well qualified to write this book because all her three daughters have achieved great success in their lives: being the CEO of YouTube, a physician/scientist at UCSF, and the founder of 23andMe.

The central philosophy is TRICK: Trust, Respect, Independence, Collaborate, and Kindness.It's best to interpret these five aspects in an interwoven manner: developing trust in your children, respecting their ways of life, and treat them with kindness so that they will become independent while able to collaborate with others.

Overall, my take-away is to treat your children as if they were trusted, respectful, and independent adults.Kindness is a type of personality parents need to develop however you interact with your children.Collaborate seems a "bonus" point built on top of the other four principles.

Although TRICK does not necessarily replace the need to educate them, it sets a very strong protocol that shapes how you would educate your children.It almost feels like a constitution of parenting where you would refer to and ensure that your ways of educating your children do not violate the fundamental principles.

Adhering to these principles would mean trade-offs.For example, the author mentioned how she dealt with her infant daughters waking up and crying in the middle of the night.She would not pick them up or nurse them to sleep; instead, she would simply pat them on the back and trust that they could fall back to sleep on their own.Another example is how she brought her grandkids to shop for stationery and decided to let them go off on their own, trusting that they could independently take the money, find the stationery, and spend the money  responsibly on stationery only (rather than buying toys and candies).
