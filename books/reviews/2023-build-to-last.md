<!-- 2023-build-to-last -->

I had quite a high expectation of this book after listening to Jim Collins' interview on the Tim Ferriss' podcast.

I did resonate with the opening of the book that we should be curious to know why and how certain companies can have a long-lasting, vibrant lifespan.

One cross-cutting problem of this book is that what it thought was vs. was not visionary companies seems outdated today. For example, the book praised Citibank over Chase but these two nowadays are mostly considered equal. Some of the visionary companies had gone obsolete, if not completely annihilated, such as Motorola. So should we or should we not follow what Motorola did? This book itself doesn't seem to have been built to last ...

Comparatively, I found Blue Ocean Strategies more timeless because the authors acknowledge that there is no constantly "Blue" companies. A company might innovate in the Blue Ocean at some times but fail to do so at other times.





The chapter about core value and purpose makes sense, although it began to raise some red flags. For example, isn't it superficial to just declare such value and purpose without the grit or the means to actualize them?

# Cult-like Cultures
The book found most visionary companies exhibit the following cult-like behavior:
- Fervently held ideology
- Indoctrination
- Tightness of fit
- Elitism

I kept thinking how one can tone down and apply these principles in running an academic research group. Here are some thoughts:
- Fervently held ideology. The group leader can be explicit and occasionally re-state the group's core mission;
- Indoctrination. I am not a big fan of indoctrination of anything; rather, I believe in influence by examples. Demonstrate the kinds of qualities you wish your students have to the students.
- Tightness of fit. I also don't fully buy this one. For PhD students, the are not fixed fits or mis-fits; rather, they have great potential to change themselves, potentially becoming more fit by closely working with the advisors.
- Elitism. This would be great only if it's not attained by blind self-belief or chanting some empty slogans. Ideally, students should aim for andx achieve great things to build up such elitism visible to each other.
