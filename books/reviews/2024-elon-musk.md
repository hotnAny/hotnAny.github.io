I listened to the audio book on my drive home.

I was really drawn by this book, by the "Musk" ways of doing things.

For example, he would make himself knowledgeable about employees' work, enough to argue with them about technical details (even though often he is wrong). Nonetheless, such attention to details really could push his employees to set a high bar for their own work, lest questioned or ridiculed by Musk.

As another example, Musk's disobedience to bullshit authorities or rules. He always questions every rule by asking "Who made this rule? Can we find that person and ask why this rule must be in place?" In this way, he demystifies rules: rules originates from humans and humans can be questioned.

Perhaps the one thing I can never see myself being like Musk is his urgency of "saving humanity", from producing low-cost electric (and self-driving) cars to moving humans to inhabit Mars. Musk is in a rush. He is constantly in some rush to catch a deadline or to resolve a crisis. Always under pressure, which in turn forces him (and people around him) to achieve great work. I don't want to work like that. I don't want to constantly be under pressure and in the fear of not making deadlines. Instead, I believe that, if you have set the right course, getting there is just a matter of time.

Musk is the perfect manifestation of Andrew Carnegie's famous saying: "My heart is in the work". He rarely enjoys normal people's enjoyments even though his fortune would allow him to enjoy whatever enjoyable without limitation. He works (and expects others too) on holidays. He hates vacations. He often lives a rather scrappy life, at times sleeps in his Tesla office, drinks tap water (when offered high-end beverage at the Twitter HQ), hires no personal assistant, just to name a few. It has always been clear that his goal is not to live a rich man's life; rather, fortune is a tool or byproduct as he works towards his multiple humanity-saving goals.
