I listened to the audiobook version of this short and engaging book. Having previously read "In Defense of Food", I quite enjoy Michael Pollan’s research and writing style.

This book feels more like an extended essay or a personal experiment report rather than a deep dive into caffeine. Pollan documents his three-month caffeine abstinence, during which he agonizingly grapples with low energy and diminished creativity—something many readers can likely relate to.

The tone is light and humorous, filled with reflections on his caffeine-deprived life and scattered with interesting anecdotes. For example, he explores how coffeehouses became cultural hubs in 17th-century London, where patrons paid a penny for a cup of coffee to hear the latest news and gossip.

There are also some scientific insights that encourage readers to reconsider their caffeine consumption. One particularly striking fact is caffeine’s relatively long half-life, which raises the question of whether that afternoon espresso is really worth it—since it might still be in your system at bedtime.

Unlike "In Defense of Food", this book didn’t leave me with a strong takeaway. However, it did make me rethink my own habits. While I don’t plan to give up caffeine, I have stopped having coffee (or even tea) in the afternoon. It also reinforced my lingering suspicion that caffeine’s effects on me might be more psychological than physiological—perhaps it’s the taste I crave rather than the stimulant itself. As a result, I’ve started experimenting with decaf and half-caf options to gradually reduce my overall caffeine intake.
