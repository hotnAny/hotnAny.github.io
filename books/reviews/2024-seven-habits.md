<!-- seven-habits -->

I first read this book---the Chinese translation---in my first or second year in college. The image that I always remembered was how the author asks the reader to imagine their own funeral and what people would have to say about them. In this way, it becomes much clearer what kinds of life one wants to lead.

Now, almost 17, 18 years later, after undergraduate, master, PhD, and pre-tenure, I came around to this book again (the audio version this time).

The main new insight was not so much about the seven habits themselves (which were still very enlightening nonetheless) but rather the way of living by principles as advocated by the author. 

The author mentioned this point in the opening chapter, that for the seven habits to work, you've got to commit to the way of living your life by principles. In my understanding, that means all the do's and don'ts, no matter large or small, should just be derivatives of one's fundamental principles. 

Perhaps this is nothing special as many people do live by what they think are principles, such as honesty, family first, and hard work. The thing that dawns on me is how we should consider personal development the same, i.e., derivatives of one's core principles. 

In contrast, there is an ocean full of other books that consider personal development as techniques rather than principles. I personally believe seven habits is much deeper and more impactful than these techniques-centric books---one of the key reasons is the emphasis on fundamentals. As the author points out, no matter what new techniques another book proposes, if they ever work, these techniques must be some derivatives of the seven habits.

Principles are great but it seems much harder to implement principles than techniques for three reasons. 

First, a principle might not specify the details of how you can implement it. For example, habit #6 is "synergize". Just one word. To implement this principle, one has to unpack this one word into strategies that work in their own situations.

Second, principles are demanding in that implementing one can mean making changes in many aspects in your life. For example, habit #4 is "think win/win", which covers pretty much any situation where there is disagreement, conflict of interest, or competition for limited resources between you and somebody else. To implement this principle you can't just focus on one of these situations; you have to deal with them all.

Finally, perhaps the most challenging part of implementing these principles is consistency. For example, habit 5 is "seek first to understand, then to be understood". What if you are working on a deadline, under a lot of stress, and really feeling the urge of telling your co-workers exactly what they should do, skipping the part where you should listen to them? Can you make an exception for this one time? Would it still be rewarding if you stick to this principle at the expense of missing the deadline?

Despite all these difficulties, I am still glad I get to know these principles. It helps knowing that every other personal development book is just some sort of derivatives of these principles, which means we can simply focus on implementing these seven principles as a life-long exercise.
