I listened to Matthew McConaughey narrate his own book and am sure the experience must have been far much better than reading texts.

McConaughey talked about his life stories in such an expressive way that feels like a monologue.

I am not familiar with most Hollywood actors but I believe McConaughey is one of a kind. He is not one who simply profits from looks or acting talents. Instead, he has been so thoughtful and introspective throughout his whole life, from deciding to pursue film instead of law school to taking multiple trips to ponder how he had led his life. 

Amidst the chaos of Hollywood, McConaughey seems to keep a level-headed mind, always knowing or seeking to figure out what he wants to become, in his life or his career. Two examples: moving back to Texas rather than living in LA like most other actors; declining many rom-com roles despite the immediate benefits (like money) until he found breakthrough projects.

This book is highly educational, although McConaughey tries to lighten the weight by making the narratives sound fun and sometimes hilarious. Many of his stories and lessons learned are not just someone else's stories; they are worth thinking about over and over again by us in the context of our own lives.
