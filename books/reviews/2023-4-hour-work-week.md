<!-- 2023-4-hour-work-week -->

I am a big fan of Tim Ferriss' podcast and his other book "Tools of Titans" so I thought I just had to take a peek at what his very earliest best-seller is about.

Expectedly, what the book proposes just categorically does not work for me. Foremost, the premise is that most people hate their 9-5 job and are just saving up money so they can enjoy not working (e.g., going on a vacation). But for me, I love working. My work defines who I am. Vacation just prepares me to work better. I am a junkie of achievements in my work. That said, I am also not a workaholic. I work for a moderate amount of time on weekdays (5 hours per day on average) and none on weekends. I enjoy a small number of non-work activities regularly: watching TV shows, reading interesting articles, jogging, and bouldering. Therefore, I, as a work-loving and work-life-balanced person, am categorically not the kind of people the 4-hour-work-week is preaching to.

I skimmed for about half the book. The contents resemble more of a cookbook rather than a systemic body of theories or tools. Admittedly, since the book was originally published in 2007, lots of insights and information are no longer new or refreshing now 16 years later. However, if you imagine what work was like in 2007, you would be amazed at how this book's ideas were so radical and forward-thinking back then. Remote work, outsourcing, small business that sells things online, automatic cashflow----these ideas only became matured and commonplace much later than this book. That's why this book deserved to be a best-seller; or, in academic custom, it deserves a lasting-impact award.
