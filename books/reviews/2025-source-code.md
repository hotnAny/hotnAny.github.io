I had been listening to this book for nearly a month when I realized it was still covering Microsoft’s early days in Albuquerque. I started to wonder how much longer it could possibly be—then, all of a sudden, it jumped into the epilogue. That’s when I realized the book focused solely on Gates’ beginnings. Apparently, I had missed the subtitle when I purchased it on Audible.

What touched me most were the prologue and the epilogue, which beautifully echoed each other. In the prologue, Gates reflects on his teenage years—how he used to go on long hikes with friends and once composed a complex BASIC program entirely in his head while hiking. The image is serene: a group of teenage boys walking through the lush greenery of the Pacific Northwest, with Gates trailing at the back, silently writing code in his mind. I believe the message Gates intended to convey is that, deep down, even after decades of navigating the tech industry and beyond, he still sees himself as that introspective, code-dreaming teenager.

Another major takeaway was just how unusual and different Gates was growing up. I couldn’t help but picture him as a real-life Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory—a squeaky-voiced, brilliant kid who challenged both family and school norms. One incident stood out: his mother asked him to step out of his room to help with something, and he snapped, “Can’t you see I’m thinking? Do you ever think? Maybe you should try it sometime.” What impressed me wasn’t just his eccentricity, but the fact that he wasn’t suppressed or forced to conform. His parents accepted him for who he was, and his school embraced his unconventional interests—going so far as to let him design the course scheduling program. I imagine many children with Gates’ potential, and similar quirks, might never reach their full promise without that kind of support.

The book reads more like a memoir than a traditional biography, leaning heavily on a chronological narrative. Still, I appreciated Gates’ honesty in recounting his early experiences—both the triumphs and the moments of regret. More than once, he admits he wishes he had been a kinder person or handled certain situations differently.

Overall, this book offers a glimpse of a Bill Gates you might not expect—not just the founder and long-time CEO of Microsoft, or the public figure we know today, but a quirky, brilliant young man who thrived doing what he loved and struggled with what he didn’t—just like many of us.
