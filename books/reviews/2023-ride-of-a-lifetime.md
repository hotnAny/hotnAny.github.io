<!-- 2023-ride-of-a-lifetime -->

Like a typical biography, Iger told his lifetime story at Disney, from running studios for ABC to gradually assuming the CEO role of the conglomerate. But his story carries some unique messages that will have a long-lasting impact on a reader. 

- For example, one lesson is how Iger always treats people with respect, whether it is his subordinates, bosses, or people whose companies his is going to buy. I believe he is well respected, as he even developed a dear friendship with Steve Jobs. I guess it must have taken one hell of a personality for Steve to consider one as a friend. In general, one’s reputation precedes one’s achievements: knowing that you are a good person will eventually pay dividends down the road.
- Another lesson is how his ambition grew steadily over the years: Iger was never complacent with what he had achieved by any point in his life; he even pondered running for the president. 
- One subtle lesson is how, as a leader, Iger seeks for impact, which has been imbued in most decisions he made throughout his career. Why bother being a leader who always has their head up against all kinds of walls? The belief in generating impact is the ultimate driving factor.
- One small lesson that Iger mentioned multiple times: you’ve got to let your people know your priorities so they know what they are fighting for in their work.

I also gained quite some knowledge about Disney by reading this book, e.g., how the company politics played a significant factor, how its animation department competed with Pixar, and how the company over the years bought one other company after another to build an empire.
