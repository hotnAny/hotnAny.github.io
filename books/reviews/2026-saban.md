Unlike most autobiographies, this book reads very differently. It is built around a large collection of quotes and anecdotes from within the “Saban-sphere”—not just from Saban himself, but from the people around him. As a reader, you can almost picture a documentary: scenes cutting between clips of Saban speaking or working, and short interviews of others recounting their own stories with him.

What lingers most in my mind is how driven Saban is. The book repeatedly mentions how he was hardly happy—or even excited—after winning a national championship game: because his team didn’t play to his standards, because he felt his recruiting slipped as a result of the game, or simply because he no longer knew what he should be doing next. What impressed me most is the sense that something beyond a national championship drives Saban—something deeply rooted in his heart. Whether it’s his love for football, for winning, or a belief that his mission will never end, it goes beyond any single outcome.

I felt that when you are competing with someone for X, that person becomes truly intimidating if what they are after lies beyond X. In that scenario, they are not afraid of losing, because win or lose, they will continue to pursue that deeper goal. You can’t stop them—not even by taking X away from them.

As I was writing this, I thought of Fan Zhongyan’s famous quote: 不以物喜，不以己悲—one should not let external circumstances determine one’s happiness or sadness. I’ve long admired this state of mind but never quite knew how to achieve it. Saban gives us a concrete example.

That, in turn, made me think about research—and the idea of having a lifelong research mission, something I’m actively trying to develop as I write this review. This feels like a very Saban-style way of thinking. It frees you from being overly excited or overly disappointed by whether a grant is funded or a paper is accepted. None of those temporary outcomes change the mission. You keep marching forward toward the same goal, regardless.

For me, that is the main takeaway from Saban.

Thank you, Coach.
