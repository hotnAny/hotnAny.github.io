Since I read this book after "Poor Dad, Rich Dad", I feel the gist is similar---to be rich or wealthy, you need to build assets, which is money that can make money for you. *A part of what I earned was mine to keep.*

Maybe this is just hindsight but, if people find this book highly inspiring, they must have been very financially illiterate ...

Perhaps this book also goes a little further by suggesting what (not) to do to accumulate wealth, such as avoiding investment without credibility and avoiding taking shortcuts.

The storytelling style also feels similarly across the two books and is probably another reason these books have been successful.

The conversations in this book were written in Old English, making it somewhat difficult to mentally read it out loud.

Some interesting finds of quotes:

> "As for study, did not our wise teacher teach us that learning was of two kinds: the one kind being the things we learned and knew, and the other being the training that taught us how to find out what we did not know?"

> Good luck can be enticed by accepting opportunity. ... Men of action are favored by the Goddess of Good Luck.
