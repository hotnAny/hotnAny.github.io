I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute in the summer of 2023 in Guangzhou.

The first chapter seems to be the most interesting and inspiring. By saying we should not give a fuck to things, the author actually means we should give a fuck to something worth giving a fuck to. In other words, we need to make a wise decision to choose something important to give a fuck to. Beyond that, everything else should not matter. This cry of not giving a fuck is in part motivated by the problem of modern humans who tend to care about too many things. There are too many of us who just need to get too many things in there lives right in order to live.

The rest of the book, to be honest, felt like a blur, maybe because the book lacks a strong structure to tie various thoughts of the authors’ together.

I remember the last chapter about facing death, about someone the author knew fell off a cliff. Indeed, in the face of death—or just the thought of its inevitability—should present us the strongest reason to say I don’t give a fuck to certain things.
