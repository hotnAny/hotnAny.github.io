<!-- 2024-coach -->

I stumbled upon this super short book by Michael Lewis. 
The topic seems like an outlier considering his other books.
Nonetheless, always a big fan of his work, I went ahead and listened to it.

It was indeed very short. Almost too short to form a long-term memory of mine.

The book is mainly about Lewis' experience of playing baseball in highschool where he had this unique experience of interacting with Coach Fitz---a more-than-stereotypical American school coach.
The stereotype---as seen in many TV shows and movies---would be a middle-aged man, tough guy, really harsh on the kids, disciplines and teamwork above everything else.
Coach Fitz is all of this multiplied by some number greater than one.
He also had kind of a legendary playing career himself but he seemed to have put his personal history behind and highly focused on coaching the youngsters.

Lewis described one of his own memorable, "being coached" experiences.
He went to a family ski trip during some holiday period while the rest of the team trained.
When he came back and pitched in a game, he struggled to perform, likely due to a lack of practice during the ski trip.
As he kept throwing Balls and sending batters to bases, Coach Fitz was loudly making a speech to the rest of the team about how Lewis was the only one that skipped practice to ski.
After the game, Lewis told his family he never wanted to go on any ski trip in the future.

Another memorable story about Coach Fitz is how the team talked about a rumor that, when his team lost, he would walk all the way home from the stadium across town. 
Everybody thought it was just a story.
But one time, after a loss, Lewis did find the coach doing the walk, as the legend goes.

I just remember a related thing Randy Pausch mentioned in his Last Lecture about how he as a kid suffered from being coached.
But he didn't grow up hating or regretting that experience; he actually spoke fondly about a few lessons he learned, in his Last Lecture.

I think Lewis might have felt the same, as many others do.
It's not just about the very sports they played or how well they played it; being coached is also about imbuing in the young mind some life-long lessons about hard work, team work, honor, failure, and perseverance.
