The main message is that you should strive to **build assets that make money for you while reducing liability**.

For example, buying and renting out a real-estate property can be asset-building because the rent can pay for the mortgage while the property's value increases--the delta is the money that this asset makes for you.

On the other hand, buying a car gives you a liability because 1) the car doesn't make money for you; 2) it costs money, e.g., gas and maintenance; and 3) its value depreciates over years.

The book takes a very compelling approach to preach this message by means of storytelling---a (fictional) story about the author's interaction with the rich dad and the poor dad.

The iterative preaching at some point almost seems like nagging but it is necessary to really imprint this message firmly into the reader's mind. Some other books tend to fill pages with contents tangentially related to the main message. This book doesn't; it simply reframes and repeats the main message. Over and over again. I find this approach much more valuable than content-filling.

The main weakness is a lack of operable advices. Maybe that's intentional---so the author can attract interested readers to his (paid) financial advising service. Maybe that's also unavoidable. You need to get the high-level message out and loud. Probably can only achieve this one goal in a book, not more.
