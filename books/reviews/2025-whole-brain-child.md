I listened to the audiobook version and found its opening chapters particularly illuminating. The authors offer a compelling framework for understanding what many parents experience as “unreasonable” toddler behavior.

Take, for example, the infamous “terrible twos,” when reasoning with a child seems impossible. The book explains that this frustration stems from the child’s developing brain: the right hemisphere, responsible for emotions, often overwhelms the still-maturing left hemisphere, which governs logic and language. In moments of distress, children quite literally cannot use their brain to regulate their feelings. The takeaway for parents is both humbling and empowering — we should comfort them first, bring them to a state of peace, and then guide them to use their left brain to realize that they do not have to feel frustrated.

While this “whole-brain” model remains more theoretical than scientifically proven, its usefulness triumphs. It reshapes how parents interpret tantrums — not as defiance, but as neurological growing pains — and suggests a gentler, more empathetic way to respond.

The latter parts of the book expand the framework into additional “whole-brain” principles that I found less convincing and less grounded. I wish the authors had instead explored the left–right brain dynamic in greater depth.
