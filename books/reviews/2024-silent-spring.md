This is a silently powerful book.

It comprehensively describes various kinds of harms humans can bring to this planet and ourselves by administering artificial chemicals for shortsighted purposes, such as killing a specific type of insect.

The chapters span multiple constituents of earth, presenting evidence after evidence how our air, soil, and water became contaminated and human health or even lives jeopardized because of uninformed and ill-controlled use of harmful chemicals.

Today, we almost take for granted that the the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat should be free---to a degree that we can choose---from harmful substance. It's hard to imagine that the US six decades ago was on the opposite end of the spectrum.

The sheer amount of evidence makes me wonder how people felt when they first read about this book published in 1962. It must have felt like a huge wak-up call. No wonder this book had such a profound impact that resonates until today.

The last chapter is full of creative ideas of how we can "naturally" inhibit certain insect population, such as inducing impotency in a subgroup of mosquitos, which will in turn become stronger and defeat the potent ones when mating, thus reducing the number of offsprings.
It's quite amazing to see such creative scientific breakthroughs, in part as a result of constraining us not to take shortcuts.
