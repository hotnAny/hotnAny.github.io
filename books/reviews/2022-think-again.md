The main message of book is to rethink what we already believe in and do not be afraid of changing our opinions and decisions.

One of the most memorable points made by the author is that, the more we question our own work, the more likely we can improve upon it.
For example, students in an exam who question answers they thought were correct were more likely to score higher overall. 
I can totally relate to this exam experience because I was one of those students who liked to play the 'red team' and try to prove my answers were wrong.
As it turned out, whether I failed or succeeded in doing so, my exam performance benefited from such exercises.

Another memorable discussion is in Chapter 8 where the author argued for news media to acknowledge the complexity of events, rather than trying to take a clear stance or to (over)simplify the facts presented to the readers.

Finally, I also learned a lot about conflicts. "The absence of conflict is not harmony, it's apathy." Sometimes we play nice to avoid personal or relationship conflict in work at the expense of making compromise in the work we perform. As it turns out, task conflicts in work are healthy are often much needed to make real progress.
