This a very practically useful and insightful book, although the entire book could have been summed up in a blog post (saving all the trees :D).

The main idea is that asking the right questions is key to effective coaching. Throughout a typical 1-on-1 meeting, here are the questions a manager should ask:

- The Kickstart Question: "What's on your mind?"
- The AWE Question: "And what else?"
- The Focus Question: "What's the real challenge here for you?"
- The Foundation Question: "What do you want?"
- The Lazy Question: "How can I help?"
- The Strategic Question: "If you're saying Yes to this, what are you saying No to?"
- The Learning Question: "What was most useful for you?"

I should really write these down on a large Post-It note and stick it under my computer monitor.

Of these questions, I personally found the AWE question makes a very noticeable difference. Whenever I hear or ask this question, I can feel the question-receiver is back to the 'thinking mode' and oft-times there will be some more discussion on a topic that would otherwise be concluded. Even though not every time the 'what else' part is significantly meaningful, developing this habit of checking if there is anything else seems in the long term a productive thing to do in every meeting.

In general, I fully agree that the best coaching is done via asking questions---questions that lead everyone to arrive at a better understanding of the problem. I also believe that, even if you don't need to ask a question, it is still better to ask one than simply making a judgmental call right away---it never hurts to hear more information.
