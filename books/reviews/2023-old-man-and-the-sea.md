I am most impressed by how this book uses simple language, slow pacing, and detail-oriented descriptions to unfold a powerful picture of the character.

The magic of writing is enabling the reader to reconstruct what the author has in their mind via nothing but text. In this spirit, Hemingway is truly the master. I believe every reader of this book, by the end of it, has gone through the same intense voyage as the old man, experiencing the arduous pain, struggle, self-empowerment, hope, and the ultimate unavoidable disappointment.

I have been reading two kinds of books. One preaches some beliefs of the authors, trying to persuade readers to think or do the same, such as every single one of those self-improvement books (4-hour something, the secret of X, etc.). The other kind tells a seemingly innocent story bearing no other intentions yet via the telling the author imprints a message upon the readerâ€™s mind much deeper than the first kind of preaching books.
