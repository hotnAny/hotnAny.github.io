I wanted to read this book because of the article about how a generation of parents named their ABC (American Born Chinese) girls Connie---after the news reporter and TV anchor Connie Chung. Connie Chung's image---good-looking, confident, unintimidated in a male-dominant profession---inspired those parents to believe that their daughters could one day be like Connie.

The book is a memoir---a chronicle of Connie Chung's personal and professional life events, written by herself (and read by herself in the audiobook I listened to).

Unlike some other Walter-Isaacson-style autobiographies, Connie's version of her life stories might seem quite unadorned. There are very few, perhaps zero, "let me teach you something young men" kinds of accounts.

There is perhaps a personality-related reason for such modesty. Connie Chung is a humble and unpretentious person. However, what hides behind such a straightforward and simple tone could be deceiving.

A reader might take away an impression that there is not much special about what Connie did, which couldn't be further from the truth. The overwhelming adversity Connie faced in her career, the numerous setbacks, and her incredible work ethics all made her life stories special and worth learning from.

For one thing, if you are from an underrepresented or disadvantaged community, you can't win a battle by just making a stance (e.g., stating how you believe you deserve equal opportunities as others); you have to put in the extra work , however much it takes, to overcome whatever in your way to achieve your goals. 

That's what Connie did. She didn't exactly run campaigns to advocate for female news professionals; she strived to become a successful one, and made it, as a powerful example to show others that what could have been said in a campaign can actually be achieved.

To conclude, if you expect some grandiose life lessons from this book, you will be disappointed; what Connie wrote about she did might sound boringly simple, perhaps because that *is* the lesson: sometimes in life, the best way to succeed is to stop complaining and boringly put in the hard work to overcome the adversities.
