I had known this book for a long time without readng it, probably since when I was still in China. The impression has been some kind of neutral slighting leaning towards negative, as most Western media tended to protray.

Now, having finally read the book (motivated by being a dad), I have to say it's a memoir with such sincerity, honesty, and courage. I applaud Amy Chua even though I don't always agree with her parenting approach and probably can never parent my children like her (even if I try to).

The first thing that strikes me is how Chua openly talks about her down-to-earth experiences of parenting her two daughters with nothing but storified events, actual conversations, and no-sugar-coating emotions. 

Unlike many other "success stories" that tend to emphasize "what works", this book never hesitates to expose the negative side of things---the frequently-occurred tension and vulnerability of the parent-child relationship. I think it takes a lot courage to open your own family up, not being afraid of others' fair or unfair judgment. 

I was a new parent when I read this book and I truly appreciate how it brought me a sense of "you are not alone", that it is okay to feel a mix of frustration and hope, love and anger, pride and disappointment.

Despite my deep appreciation of this book's experiential impact on me, I don't think I agree with or adopt Chua's parenting approach.

Overall, my philosophy is more aligned with [TRICK](https://hci.prof/books/#2024-how-to-raise-successful-people) where I believe the ultimate parenting goal is to enable your children to successfully become the person they want to be. The fundamental problem of Chua's approach is a lack of exploration of what the children want; instead, playing musical instruments was simply prescribed as their goal whereupon all the efforts abnd hardships were hinged. In hindsight, maybe the children did love and want to play musical instruments and the ends would have seemed to justify the means. However, how would you ever know whether things might go the other way, that the children never have the opportunities to discover what they are really passionate about.

Maybe my approach, afterall, will be a hybrid one: the Western way of guiding the children to discover their passion and then the Eastern way of pushing them to become as succssful as possible.
