(I only read the introduction and conclusion of this book)

My main take-away is that states’ attempts to apply over-simplified models to create administratively-convenient structures of people will fail, as demonstrated in my historical incidences.

Skimming this book strengthens my belief that political science writing is not for me. I tried to read "Bowling Alone" but failed, as I thought the writing is too disorganized and unnecessarily lengthy. This book shows similar patterns but a little more bearable. I enjoy reading neither, though.

If I get the gist right, it seems non-rocket-science. If you preach this book to any politicians (in democratic countries), they are very likely to agree with it. But the catch is: how can we realize what the book proposes (see below). The author doesn't seem to offer any actionable solutions.

The author points out four elements that lead to states' social engineering efforts:
1. "The administrative ordering of nature and society"---my understanding is that the use of an administratively-convenient approach in structuring people's lives;
2. "A high-modernist ideology"---my understanding is that the blind optimism about the bright future of science and technology as the premise of decision-making;
3. "An authoritarian state that is willing and able to use the full weight of its coercive power to bring these high-modernist designs into being";
4. "A prostrate civil society that lacks the capacity to resist these plans";

Some quotes that capture this book
> Much of this book can be read as a case against the imperialism of high-modernist planned social order.

> Throughout the book I make the case for the indispensable role of practical knowledge, informal processes, and improvisation in the face of unpredictability.

> Common law, as an institution, owes its longevity to the fact that it is not a final codification of legal rules, but rather a set of procedures for continually adapting some broad principles to novel circumstances.

Some "solutions". (I don't think any of the following is really innovative; some might sound a little cliché. It's not that we never heard of these ideas but we probably have been struggling realizing them ...)
1. "Take small steps ... prefer wherever possible to take a small step, stand back, observe, and then plan the next small move"
2. "Favor reversibility. Prefer interventions that can easily be undone if they turn out to be mistakes."
3. "Plan on surprises. Choose plans that allow the largest accommodation to the unforeseen."
4. "Plan on human inventiveness ... those who become involved in the project later will have or develop the experience and insight to improve on the design."
