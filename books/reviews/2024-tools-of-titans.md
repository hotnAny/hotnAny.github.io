I haven't really finished this book but already read most of it so I think it's time to do a review.

First of all, this is an unusual book--a collection of "nuggets" from Tim Ferriss' interviews over the years with people who are very good at certain things, e.g., from winning championships in sports to founding impactful companies.

As suggested, the way I read this book is also unusual.Instead of going through it linearly, since the chapters are short and highly independent of each other, I can just randomly flip open a chapter and sample what is useful to me.I would only read one chapter or less each time, allowing the "nugget" to sink in and internalize into my own knowledge.Putting together such fragmented reading periods on and off over 1-2 years, I actually have gone through most of the book.

Overall, I wish more books were like this: condensing lessons learned from others and allowing for fragmented reading.This is not to say traditional, continuous, linear reading is bad; quite the opposite--it's important to be able to read in the traditional way in such an age of massive, shallow online information.This book stands out by making book reading more tractable given how we might be already losing the ability to read books.Hopefully, we can use books like this one to help us regain our general book reading ability.
