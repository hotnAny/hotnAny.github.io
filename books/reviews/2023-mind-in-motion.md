As summarized on the book jacket, the main thesis is that "movement and our interactions in space, not language, are the true foundation of thought". For one, thinking occurred much earlier before language so movement in space had a better chance of influencing thinking at a more foundational level.

This book is another difficult one to read.

The whole book reads like a prose. Colloquial. Easy to understand at the individual sentences level; yet hard to put together what's the take-away altogether.

A better way to organize this book would have been following the **nine laws of cognition**, which I think are the most salient message this book can deliver. However, the unstructured organization makes it hard to deep-dive into each individual law, leaving the reader wondering what each law means exactly.

Some quotes for thought.

The book talks about representations of space in our mind. A nice example is map. Maps that are useful for navigation are a special representation of the actual geographic information. Roads appear wider than what you would see on a satellite image. Some details are removed (e.g., textures of terrains) and some (artificial ones) added, e.g., names of roads and streets.

Representations are not static. Our mind "plays with" representations.
> ... a useful way to think about mental transformations is as internalized actions. Just as representations can be regarded as internalized perceptions.

How structures are mirrored across domains. (This instantly reminds me of Conway's law, which says that the structure of software mirrors that of the development team.)
> Ninth Law of Cognition: We organize the stuff in the world the way we organize the stuff in the mind.

Externalization enhances thinking (I learned about this a long time ago in my InfoVis class by the example of mathematical notation systems help us calculate by externalizing the process).
> If thinking is internalized action, then externalizing actions on thought as gestures that perform miniatures of the actions should help the thinking.
