Overall, this book, consisting of a collection of short essays on how humans deal with financial decisions, clearly crosses the bar of being a must-read for personal finance. There aren't necessarily brand new insights or "secrete sauce" of investment; the power of this book really lies in making some important financial knowledge accessible to the broader audience.

## Play the long game

Rather than manipulating individual stocks and frequently reacting to short-term market changes, the key to wealth is rather about sticking to simple investment strategy (e.g., buying S&P 500) stretched over a long time.

Due to the compounding nature of investment, time plays a significant role in accumulating wealth. Warren Buffet is not necessarily the best investor at any given time, but he started really early and over time made himself historically the best investor.

I consider this principle analogous to deciding which lane to drive on when traveling long distances. It might be tempting to switch lanes based on which one is the fastest *right now*. However, frequently switching lanes is exhausting, sometimes dangerous, and often gives you marginal speed increase. Over the long term, you'd probably be better off if you'd stay in the leftmost lane, which takes less effort in driving, safer, and is statistically the fastest choice.

## Humans are not always rational

Humans make decisions that at the time seem the best, such as buying the currently hottest stock or saving a large sum of money after a recession.

Humans have other concerns than maximizing the gain of wealth, such as choosing to pay off a house for a peace of mind rather than wisely taking a mortgage while investing the money elsewhere.

Humans think biasedly, such as believing more in the sides of story that support our financial decision with a tendency of dismissing the opposing voices.

## How the book was written

The book is quite easy to read, not just because the writing uses simple and clear language, but also due to the short chapters, each of which was originally a blog post. 

I think this is a pragmatic strategy to write a book. Rather than working linearly from scratch, we can start by writing short essays or blog posts under some common themes. Later, if there is a critical mass, we can expand and organize these short texts into a whole book.

Another effective style of writing is how the author often use non-financial stories as a precursor to draw people's attention and help them take in the otherwise hard-to-swallow advices that might go against their existing beliefs.
