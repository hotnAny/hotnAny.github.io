A great book should, foremost, change people's belief. "Deep work" does exactly that. Although it was originally published awhile ago, it is still refreshing to realize how most of our daily work is shallow. Bombarded by the ever-presence of social media, we didn't realize it is not ok to be constantly distracted. Yes, we get by and we (kinda) get work done. But what about the quality and efficiency of our work? Some of the best parts of "Deep Work" come from the stories of people like Carl Jung, William Shockley, and Bill Gates who were able to relentlessly focus on their work. What if we could do the same with our own work? More importantly, deep work is more than just about work; it's about our brain. Similar to what Nicholas Carr argue in his book, Cal Newport also believes that our brain has been rewired by the long-term consumption of fragmented information on social media. The solution? Schedule time to exclusively focus on work and reject distraction (while also leave time for shallow work as well). Quit social media. Embrace boredom and stop checking on your phone. Amongst the many other things.
