Eat Food. Not Too Much. Mostly Plants.

When you can summarize and remember an entire book by such a short yet action-packed sentence, you know it'd be a great read.

The book starts by rethinking and criticizing the nutritionists' approach towards food, that anything we eat is just a combination of a bunch of nutrients and non-nutrients. Such an approach often leads to promoting or demoting certain kinds of food because of a specific (non-)nutrient, while ignoring the integration of multiple elements as well as the context of eating (e.g., when that food is consumed and with what other kinds of food).

The book thus advocate a more holistic approach---we should consider the healthiness of food as a whole not by isolating some specific nutrients it contains. The rule of thumb, therefore, is not to eat nutrients (or lack thereof) artificially combined together (e.g., processed food).

In terms of amount (i.e., not too much), there is comparison between how the French vs. the Americans eat. Although the French is known for some seemingly unhealthy diet (e.g., foie gras), they are overall healthier than Americans because they eat higher-quality food in relatively smaller quantity whereas American portions are known to be huge. Further, they don't snack as much as Americans.

I also quite like how the book argues for organic, farm-grown plants as food, that those plants tend to perform more sufficient photosynthesis process than the ones grown industrially. The more photosynthesis, the more nutrients the plant can accumulate throughout its growth.

Overall, a down-to-earth, science-backed book that can change your eating behavior---but only if you drive yourself to follow those three simple principles.
