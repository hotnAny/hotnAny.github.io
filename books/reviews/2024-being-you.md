Overall, a thought-provoking book. A very hard and controversial topic. The book did not answer all the questions but still makes a significant leap in advancing our understanding of how we come to be ourselves---our consciousness.

## The framework for unpacking the mysterious consciousness
The author's framework is "level-content-self". First, there are different levels of consciousness; then, there are different things to be conscious about (e.g., different emotional responses to what we perceive); finally, put together, there is a sense of being oneself. "Selfhood" is just a part of one's consciousness---a collection of bodily states

## The real problem vs. the hard problem
The hard problem, coined by philosopher David Chalmers, is to explain why and how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experiences, or qualia. It questions why certain brain activities are accompanied by an awareness of those activities and what it feels like to have those experiences.

The real problem, pursued by this book, is more tractable, which is "to *explain*, *predict*, and *control* the phenomenological properties of conscious experience".

To me, these two problems are fundamentally different with very little overlap, even though the author argues that solving the real problem goes after the hard problem. The names also seem misleading: I'd call the hard problem "the real problem" and the real problem "the easy problem".

## Intelligence vs. consciousness
Intelligence is different from consciousness. Since there is artificial intelligence, maybe there should be artificial consciousness? What can simulate now is intelligence, not consciousness. Just because an AI agent behaves intelligently (e.g., mimicking a human with a super high fidelity) doesn't mean it has consciousness.

## The evolutionary perspective
The Darwinian angle could be one way to explain why we humans happen to be a unique species with consciousness---it's because such consciousness (e.g., the selfhood that makes us treasure our existence) was chosen evolutionarily just like other attributes that make a species stronger, more likely to survive than the others without those attributes.

"Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system", which explains the practical need of having consciousness: being conscious about ourselves allows us to anticipate future events in the world and in our body for better response to those events.

The author used the home heating system as a metaphor: having no consciousness is like a system that only reacts to temperature changes (if colder, emit more heat) whereas, with consciousness, a system can predict that temperature might drop and proactively start increasing heat emission.

## Free will
I believe there are definitely wills, i.e., what we do is not random. But is there free will? What does it even mean to be free?

Free will might just an illusion in the sense that it's not fundamentally different from how one feels certain emotion when seeing a particular color. Free will is a "perceptual experience"---how we *feel* we have control of what we do, very much thanks to evolution (those who feel free will are more likely to survive).

The alternative theory'd be that free will exists as a god-like or soul-like origin that causes every single action we take. One argument against this view would be that our brain can process information and command bodily actions in ways that we are unaware of. Even when we *feel* we have free will over certain actions we take, there are critical small decisions about of those actions that take place without being willed.

## Free Energy Principles
To exist means to fend off the second law of thermodynamics (all things' entropy tends to increase).

> ... organism maintains themselves in the low-entropy states that ensure their continued existence by actively minimising this measurable quantity called free energy

Living systems expect themselves to be in a low-entropy state (required to stay alive) and sense the current state (plus predicting the future state) allows them to stay alert of the difference between what they anticipate to happen and what actually happens, therefore being able to minimize such differences.

## Unsorted thoughts
"Levelizing" seems one recurring approach of tackling very hard problem, such as [autonomous driving](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3016_202104/) and [artificial general intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02462). The author takes this approach too by breaking down consciousness into several levels

Consciousness is an example of how the definition of X evolves as studies are conducted on various aspects of X.

Optimistically, if we could understand life by studying a series of bio-activities, we could do the same with consciousness---by studying a series of brain activities.

When we choose to measure something about X, we also choose to ignore the other things about X that are not measurable.
