<!-- 2023-minor-feelings -->

I listened to the audio book version read by the author in a slow and slightly depressing tone.

The book tells the author's own life stories of being an Asian American, centered around her experiences and interactions with a few Asian American friends.

Personally, I find it really hard to put a label on what messages the author is sending in this book, because Asian Americans, in my opinion, have been a troubling ethnic group with complex issues, such as the cultural clashes between living in their Asian parents' world and blending in with other non-Asian Americans.

Perhaps the primary sentiment that arises from this book is Asian Americans' feeling of not belonging in and unempathized by an American society. Such a sentiment is intensely embodied in and intertwined with other personal complexities in the author's own life stories.

The part that focuses on the tragic death of the artist Theresa Hak Kyung Cha is an excellent and commendable, especially where the author interviewed Theresa's brother and did her own research from court records to surface great details of how Theresa was raped and murdered. Listening to nothing but hard cold facts, which were eluded in most other accounts, I found that part of the book immensely powerful.

The take-away? Maybe start by acknowledging that complex nature of Asian Americans' issues rather than attempting to treat it as black and white (pun intended). The worst part about stereotyping Asian Americans is that it leads to some automatic marginalization of what otherwise should be addressed in much more nuanced and systemic ways. The attempt to unpack such minor feelings is the first step towards creating a society more inclusive of all population groups.
