<!-- 2023-minor-feelings -->

I listened to the audio book version read by the author in a slow and slightly depressing tone.

The book tells the author's own life stories of being an Asian American, centered around her experiences and interactions with a few Asian American friends.

Personally, I find it really hard to put a label on what messages the author is sending in this book, because Asian Americans, in my opinion, have been a troubling ethnic group with complex issues, such as the cultural clashes between living in their Asian parents' world and blending in with other non-Asian Americans.

Perhaps the primary sentiment that arises from this book is Asian Americans' feeling of not belonging in and unempathized by an American society. Such a sentiment is intensely embodied in and intertwined with other personal complexities in the author's own life stories.

The part that focuses on the tragic death of the artist Theresa Hak Kyung Cha is an excellent and commendable, especially where the author interviewed Theresa's brother and did her own research from court records to surface great details of how Theresa was raped and murdered. Listening to nothing but hard cold facts, which were eluded in most other accounts, I found that part of the book immensely powerful.

The take-away? Maybe start by acknowledging that complex nature of Asian Americans' issues rather than attempting to treat it as black and white (pun intended). The worst part about stereotyping Asian Americans is that it leads to some automatic marginalization of what otherwise should be addressed in much more nuanced and systemic ways. The attempt to unpack such minor feelings is the first step towards creating a society more inclusive of all population groups.

I thought I didn't review this book so wrote the following a few months later ...

I listened to the audio book version in which the author tells her life’s story as an Asian American, a friend, a poet, and most importantly, a person whose struggling is often multiplexed by these identifies.  

It’s hard to seriously review on this book because, in my interpretation, the book is highly personal and listening to the audio version makes it more like a person rather than pages of text. I don’t feel comfortable reviewing a person’s life.

I also feel weirdly objective when listening to the book, although as an Asian (Chinese) I am supposed to be able to better relate to the author than the majority of readers. I honestly can’t. Being born and raised in China as an Asian is vastly different than growing up in America as an Asian. Studying STEM also puts me in a world vastly different from that of poetry (or Arts and Humanities in general). 

I honestly don’t remember much of about the book. Most of the listening took place in the middle of the night when I took care of my newborn. I remember the slow, deep, and calm voice of the author. I remember her turbulent relationship with her friends. I remember the last part of the book is devoted to almost like an investigative reporting of the case of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha—a New York based Korean-American artist who was raped and murdered and ignored by the authorities.

In contrast to the mainstream idealogical movements (e.g., the overthrow of affirmative actions) regarding racial and cultural underrepresentation, this book simply tells a single person’s story. It feels like a breeze that refreshes our senses, making us listen, keeping us grounded, and teaching us to pay attention to the individuals because it is what the individuals experience in their lives that would ultimately manifest any idealogical movements.
