This is very likely the best book I read in 2023.

The topic (as well as the title) might not seem that enticingâ€”it's about the venture capital world narrated from the perspectives of the investors (rather than the entrepreneurs).

The main idea is that VCs follow the power law. They are in the home run (or even grand slam) business. They only invest on 100x or even more returns even though the chance of failure is high (i.e., there is a long tail of investments with little or nor returns). The corollary is that if your start-up idea is relatively safe with very moderate return of investment then it is very unlikely to be funded.

There are a lot to like about how the author wrote this books.

First, the writing is captivating, especially the first half, as the book tells how VC was such a heretic idea and was pioneered by just a few outlying figures in the early days. There are also various stories between famous companies and VCs, such as how Steve Jobs once tried to sell half of Apple's equity to Atari's founder for a few tens of thousands of dollars but was turned down. Another Apple-related story was, in its early days, a British investor refused to leave the company's lobby unless he could purchase some equity. He eventually did it thanks to Steven Woz's needs for liquidity and, later, got a ton of return from this purchase.

Second, this book is pretty much the history book of Silicon Valley, by reading which you can learn everything from the very first generation of tech entrepreneurs (Fairchild) to the various companies that dominated each decade (Cisco, Apple, Uber, etc.) and to the oversea portions that involve Russian and Chinese investors. It also feels like a bonus benefit that you get to familiarize yourself with tech industry's history by learning about VCs.

So, it's obvious that every founder should read this book. Everything founders learn tend to come from founders' perspectives: how to identify the next big idea, how to pitch the idea, how to negotiate a term sheet, how to run a company, and so on. But if you could think like a VC, such empathy goes a long way in helping you interact with and further convince them to invest in your company.
