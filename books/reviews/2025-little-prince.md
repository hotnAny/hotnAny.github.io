I read this book while staying at the hospital, waiting for the birth of my second child. It felt fitting to read a children’s book written for adults during such a moment of anticipation and reflection.

As expected, the depth of the book lies in how one interprets its seemingly childlike elements: the pilot, the little prince, and the series of unrealistically small yet survivable planets inhabited by eccentric characters.

What left the strongest impression on me was the little prince’s journey to these various planets. As adults, we might recognize aspects of ourselves—at least to some degree—in the planet dwellers he encounters. Take, for instance, the king who rules no one, simply because he is the only inhabitant of his world. More broadly, I interpret these visits as metaphors for how we each live on our own tiny "planet": repeating similar routines every day, driven by motivations that may seem peculiar to others but make sense to us alone.

If a little prince were to visit our real-life "planet," his innocent and probing questions might compel us to pause and reflect: What exactly are we doing? Why? And what makes any of it meaningful?

This outsider’s perspective—seeing ourselves through the eyes of the little prince—is, in itself, a valuable realization. That, for me, is the most important takeaway from this book.
