This book is a follow-up by the author, focused on methods to attain joy.

The key belief is that joy is not a myth; rather, one can train themselves to become more joyful, just like doing physical exercises to become fitter.

The author discussed three levels of techniques:

1. *Keep a peaceful mind*, which is more likely to experience joy than otherwise.
The goal is "resting the mind to put it into a state of ease".
The primary exercise here is meditation, which also sets on the foundation of a relaxed, peaceful mind.
Although some people might attempt to tame their mind to not think about things, the author suggest a different perspective.
Essentially, all that we can do is to set our body and environment ready and let the mind settle itself, just like when you rest a snow globe on a stable, flat surface, the snowflakes will eventually settle.
Another mental model I found useful is thinking of the mind as a puppy that likes to wander around when you try to meditate. Treat it like a puppy. Gently and lovingly call it back while accepting that it is a puppy's nature to love to wander.

2. *Lean into joy*---train the mind to become sensitive to even small things that are joyful.
One useful exercise is the "mindfulness breadth": whenever possible, take a deep breadth while paying full attention to it. That's it. Just one breadth and it can already bring you very noticeable amount of joy.
Similarly, notice other simple joyful things, from a morning breeze to the first bite of delicious food and to the moment you get into a hot shower. Sometimes, even realizing that you are currently pain-free is another reason to feel joy.

3. *Infuse joy*---perform regular exercises that will "uplift the mind" to experience joyfulness.
One unique method is wishing random people happy. That's it. It could be a colleague that walks by your desk or someone you know but have not met for a long time. For me, I even tried wishing the driver in front of my car happy, which is a very difficult thing to do in LA.

As I thought I finished the gist of this book, I started to think about its limitations. I don't think this these are universal techniques to obtain joy. Rather, there is a strong assumption about the "baseline", that the person is largely free from pain, hunger, and danger. I don't think a person living in a war zone would find this books' techniques useful to bring them joy.
