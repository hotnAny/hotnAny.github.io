Scarcity is simply defined as "having less than you feel you need".

Benefits and trade-offs of scarcity:
> Scarcity captures the mind. Just as the starving subjects had food on their mind, when we experience scarcity of any kind, we become absorbed by it. The mind orients automatically, powerfully, toward unfulfilled needs.

> Scarcity captures our attention, and this provides a narrow benefit: we do a better job managing pressing needs. But more broadly, it costs us: we neglect other concerns ...

The central weakness of this book is that scarcity functions less as an explanatory theory than as a framing device. It does offer a useful lens for reinterpreting familiar behaviors—for instance, why people facing poverty often make decisions that appear to worsen their situation. In that sense, the book succeeds in prompting readers to see certain problems differently.

I found myself briefly adopting this lens in my own work. There was a program committee meeting in January, I anticipated that many reviewers would postpone their reviews until the start of the month, creating a last-minute rush and potentially lowering review quality. I sent reminders in mid-December, encouraging reviewers to start earlier. Through the book’s framework, this could be described as addressing reviewers’ scarcity of time: encouraging earlier action effectively expands their available bandwidth later. Seen this way, the intervention neatly fits the scarcity narrative.

Yet this example also exposes the book’s limitation. One does not need the concept of scarcity to arrive at such insights or interventions. I would have sent those reminders regardless of having read this book. There are simpler, more intuitive explanations for the same phenomena. In this case, “people procrastinate and forget; reminders help” seems both sufficient and more straightforward than invoking scarcity. The book often appears to retrofit everyday observations into a scarcity framework rather than demonstrating why that framework is necessary or uniquely powerful.

Moreover, the concept of scarcity itself seems insufficient to carry the analytical weight the authors place on it. This may explain why the book introduces additional constructs such as tunneling and bandwidth. While these ideas are often interesting, their relationship to scarcity is not always clear. At times, entire sections focus on tunneling with little or no reference back to scarcity, leaving the reader uncertain about which concept is truly central to the book’s thesis.

In the end, while the book offers a compelling vocabulary and several thought-provoking examples, its core concept feels overstretched. Scarcity works well as a metaphor and an organizing frame, but it rarely delivers insights that could not be reached through more direct, less intellectualized reasoning.
