Life and death are just ideas rather than reality. Instead, think of life and death as manifestation. When the conditions are ready, life manifests and when it's time, death manifests.

Although this is mainly a religious or philosophical point of view, it has some scientific truth in it.
The materials that comprise a life have always existed and will not disappear when death arrives---they simply undergo transformation between different configurations.

Having read about this book's philosophy, I'd combine some other books' and come to realize the three important ideas about life and death:

1. An individual's lifespan is an extremely tiny spark compared to the spatial and temporal vastness of the universe;
2. What you are made of have always existed, long before your birth and long after your death;
3. The only valuable part of your life that is the most worthy of living is the present moment.

Well, now the important question is: does this book really remove my fear of death? To be honest, no, and I think that's evolutionarily reasonable. Humans have evolved through generations using the fear of death as the motivation to survive and thrive. It's encoded in our genes and can't be simply taken out in one generation by reading a book. Perhaps an addendum to the above three points is: the fear of death (or desire to keep living) is a feature of our current configuration.

Finally, I also remember a few brief remarks on Buddhism, which would never force someone to follow its tenet or punish those who don't. To me, that's the only way religions should be and the only reason we would want freedom of religion; everything else is just pretenders and doesn't deserve to call themselves religions.
