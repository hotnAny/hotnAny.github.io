> Health: A physiological state in which there is an absence of disease or pathology and that maintains the necessary biologic balance between the catabolic and anabolic states.

"Fitness" doesn't seem to have a direct connection to health
> Fitness: The bodily state of being physiologically capable of handling challenges that exist above a resting threshold of activity.

Therefore, exercise needs to maintain a balance of fitness and health.

Given certain amount of time ...
> You achieve a greater training effect if you put more effort into your exercise

> It is during "recovery" from high-intensity exercise that you're actually getting an increased stimulation of the aerobic system equal to or greater than what you would get from conventional stated-state "aerobic" exercise.

> It is also important to understand that since muscle is the basic mechanical system being served by the aerobic system, as muscle strength improves, the necessary support systems (which include the aerobic system) must follow suit.
> This explains why many middle-aged people and senior citizens note a loss of muscle (a condition linked to aging and known as sarcopenia), as whenever a muscle's mass and strength are decreased, all of its metabolic systems downsize as well. This phenomenon carries profoundly negative health consequences.
