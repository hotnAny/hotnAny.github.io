The gist of this book:
> The most time-efficient and productive exercise program is one based upon the principles of high-intensity training. Productive exercise must be of a threshold level of intensity (as any level below this threshold will not stimulate maximal results). As a result, high-intensity exercise sessions will be comparatively brief and infrequently performed (as opposed to conventional exercise programs).

Defining health:
> Health: A physiological state in which there is an absence of disease or pathology and that maintains the necessary biologic balance between the catabolic and anabolic states.

"Fitness" doesn't seem to have a direct connection to health
> Fitness: The bodily state of being physiologically capable of handling challenges that exist above a resting threshold of activity.

Therefore, exercise needs to maintain a balance of fitness and health.

Given certain amount of time ...
> You achieve a greater training effect if you put more effort into your exercise

Strength vs. cardio training:
> It is during "recovery" from high-intensity exercise that you're actually getting an increased stimulation of the aerobic system equal to or greater than what you would get from conventional stated-state "aerobic" exercise.

> It is also important to understand that since muscle is the basic mechanical system being served by the aerobic system, as muscle strength improves, the necessary support systems (which include the aerobic system) must follow suit.
> This explains why many middle-aged people and senior citizens note a loss of muscle (a condition linked to aging and known as sarcopenia), as whenever a muscle's mass and strength are decreased, all of its metabolic systems downsize as well. This phenomenon carries profoundly negative health consequences.

Fat is not the culprit:
> Throughout human history, the ready availability of food was the exception rather than the rule. The ability to eat when food was available and to store excess caloric energy for future use allowed people to survive when food aws not at hand. Fat storage is the sign of good health, as it signals that metabolic resources are abundant and the organism is thriving.

> For about 150,000 generations, efficient fat storage was essential for survival, but only three to four generations have seen efficient fat storage lead to obesity.

The case against (refined) carbs:
> If you consume 2,000 calories of refined carbohydrates, the metabolic cost of processing this intake and converting it into stored energy (bodyfat) is close to zero. If you instead consume lean meats, fruits, and vegetables, the metabolic cost of converting these foodstuffs into usable energy is high. This concept is known as the "thermic cost of digestion".

Getting to known insulin:
> Insulin is a hormone that is produced in the pancreas. Its overall, large-spectrum function is to drive nutrient storage; its moment-to-moment function is to maintain stable blood sugar.
> ... insulin levels have to be controlled to create a permissive environment for fat mobilization.

Why omega-3 fatty acids help fat loss
> If your diet is made up of natural foodstuffs that resemble a hunter-gatherer diet, you're going to be ingesting omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids at a ratio of roughly one to one. With this healthful ratio, a large component of your cell walls will be made up of omega-3 fatty acids and because these fatty acids are elongated and flexible, the cell walls will be fully expanded placing all of the hormonal receptors on the exterior of the cell facing outward towards the environment, where they can appropriately interact with circulating hormones.

Summary of what to do for fat loss
- eat natural, unprocessed foods
- stay cool
- sleep well and sleep cool
- avoid stress as much as possible
- employ high-intensity exercise

Aside from the exercise part, there is something I like about this book's writing style. I can't quite put my finger on it: it somehow feels like listening to some very experienced, seasoned football coaches vividly talk about football in their own language.
