Naval Ravikant has always seemed like a mythical creature to me. 
His Twitter account follows zero others and the profile image is a sketch that looks like a superhero character.
I have read (or listened?) a little of his writing and remember fondly how it was quite illuminating.
Otherwise, I knew quite little about this famous person.

This book was actually not written by Ravikant, but by two others who think the world deserves a compilation of all Ravikant's wisdom in a single package.

I listened to this book on and off over the course of a few days, which in retrospect might not be a good idea.
Because Ravikant has so many thought-provoking ideas, it'd be impossible to fully digest them all at once.
The right way to access this book should be reading it a little bit every now and then, leaving time to think about and act on the ideas.

Despite force-feeding myself, I still managed to digest a few bits of Ravikant's wisdom.
The one that really strikes me is how he is so level-headed about the nothingness of each individual or even the human society as a whole.
Ravikant reminds us that in the grand scheme of things---how the universe has been around for such a long time and how it will eventually vanish---should constantly remind us that we shouldn't be bothered by whatever we think are big deals in our lives.
Steve Jobs said something similar about the thought of death should free you from fear.
Ravikant goes even further, reminding us even the seemingly rich history or promising future of humans mean nothing considering how humans' existence is just a spark in the duration of the universe' existence.
A spark that starts and ends in no time. 
Each individual, the society, the human race, the living things, the earth, or the solar system and beyond are all collapsed within this spark.
Ravikant doesn't mean to say this in a pessimistic tone although it truly sounds like it no matter how it is said; what he tries to get at is we should enjoy the ride of our extremely short existence and do not let those meaningless negative emotions get in the way.
