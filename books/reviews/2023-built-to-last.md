<!-- 2023-built-to-last -->

I had quite a high expectation of this book after listening to Jim Collins' interview on the Tim Ferriss' podcast.

I did resonate with the opening of the book that we should be curious to know why and how certain companies can have a long-lasting, vibrant lifespan.

One cross-cutting problem of this book is that what it thought was vs. was not visionary companies seems outdated today. For example, the book praised Citibank over Chase but these two nowadays are mostly considered equal. Some of the visionary companies had gone obsolete, if not completely annihilated, such as Motorola. So should we or should we not follow what Motorola did? This book itself doesn't seem to have been built to last ...

Comparatively, I found Blue Ocean Strategies more timeless because the authors acknowledge that there is no constantly "Blue" companies. A company might innovate in the Blue Ocean at some times but fail to do so at other times.

The chapter about core value and purpose makes sense, although it began to raise some red flags. For example, isn't it superficial to just declare such value and purpose without the grit or the means to actualize them?

## Cult-like Cultures
The book found most visionary companies exhibit the following cult-like behavior:
- Fervently held ideology
- Indoctrination
- Tightness of fit
- Elitism

I kept thinking how one can tone down and apply these principles in running an academic research group. Here are some thoughts:
- Fervently held ideology. The group leader can be explicit and occasionally re-state the group's core mission;
- Indoctrination. I am not a big fan of indoctrination of anything; rather, I believe in influence by examples. Demonstrate the kinds of qualities you wish your students have to the students.
- Tightness of fit. I also don't fully buy this one. For PhD students, they are not fixed fits or mis-fits; rather, they have great potential to change themselves, potentially becoming more fit by closely working with the advisors.
- Elitism. This would be great only if it's not attained by blind self-belief or chanting some empty slogans. Ideally, students should aim for and achieve great things to build up such elitism visible to each other.

## Try a Lot of Stuff and Keep What Works

At first, this might seem orthogonal to having a core value/purpose. The American Express story about how they seized the opportunity to go against their CEO and get into the travel service business illustrates the connection:

> In spite of Fargo's dictum, that's exactly what AmEx did. The company had developed a pattern of solving customer problems and quickly exploiting opportunities--an impulse guided by its core ideology of heroic customer service--that could not be easily suppressed, even by the CEO.

About thriving on accidental opportunities (aka. pivoting?)
> We're not saying that these companies never had plans. But we were surprised to find so many examples of key moves by the visionary companies that came about by some process other than planning

What's the relationship of this principle and BHAG (Big Hairy Ambitious Goal)?
> It uses BHAGs to define a mountain to climbing, users evolution to invent   a way to the top.

Bumper stickers to be repurposed for academic use:

- "Give it a try---and quick!" I tend to think of this synonymous to Meta/Facebook's "move fast and break things" culture (except the latter is quite unconstrained by the other considerations below);
- "Accept that mistakes will be made";
- "Take small steps"---the bigger the risk, the faster the pace, the smaller the step should be and the more necessary to reflect on each step taken before making the next one;
- "Give people the room they need";

> We find that managers often underestimate the importance of this fifth lesson and fail to translate their intentions into tangible mechanisms.
Overall, to foster these habits above, it's important to reinforce a culture. For example, instead of abstractly chatting about new ideas in meetings, encourage students to act on ideas, quickly try something small, and accept the high chance that it might not work.

## Other Take-Away's

Sony's core purpose could be a good example:
> To experience the joy of advancing and applying technology for the benefit of the public.

A few 'myths' of core values:
- Core values are not made up or created; core values are discovered within what a company is already doing or what to do;
- Core values might not be differentiable as multiple companies could claim they have the same core values (but not every one will devote to those values as much as the others);
- Core values cannot be imposed on employees; rather, a company should find and retain employees that share or have a predisposition to share the core values.
