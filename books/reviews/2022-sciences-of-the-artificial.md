I found this one in the pile of books in my office. I must have at some point read a reference to it, bought the book, intending to read it, but eventually forgot (like many other books bought from abebooks.com).

It was exciting enough to see the name Herbert A. Simon, although I wasn't aware how significant this book is compared to the others Simon wrote.
This very short book is actually a collection of lecture notes from when Simon gave a seminar at MIT in 1968.

Overall, the book reads like a collection (to be precise, four of them) of Simon's thoughts on artificial intelligence and its enabling complex system:

### 1. What is the fundamental difference (or, relationship) between the artificial and the natural world?
- Sciences study the natural world by asking **how things are** while engineering and design study the artificial world by asking ***how things ought to be**. I find this resonates with Scott Hudson's dichotomy of HCI research as discovery vs. invention.
- A complex system can be defined by how it is expected to behave in response to a given external environment. In that sense, whether the inside of the system is artificial matters less than its behavior. In other words, the boundary between the natural and the artificial blurs when either can behave equivalently to the other as defined by a given external environment.

#### Quotes
Interesting take on the word 'artificial':
> Our language seems to reflect man's deep distrust of his own products ... "artificial" ... as meaning man-mande, as opposed to natural.

How to define engineering:
> ... prospective artificial objects having desired properties---are the central objective of engineering activity and skill. The engineer is concerned with how things *ought* to be---ought to be, that is, in order to attain goals, and to *function*.

The argument for a divided look at inner vs. outer environments:
> ... the first advantage of dividing outer from inner environment in studying an adaptive or artificial system is that we can often predict behavior from knowledge of the system's goals and its outer environment, with only minimal assumptions about the inner environment.

The historical significance of simulation:
> Simulation, as a technique for achieving understanding and predicting the behavior of systems, predates, of course, the digital computer. The model basin and the wind tunnel are valued means for studying the behavior of large systems by modeling them in the small ...

### 2. How do human being's cognitive system behave to solve problems?
- This chapter describes many psychological experiments that shed light on theories of how the inner environment of our brain works. For example, there might be a distinction between short- and long- term memories and the information transfer between them.

#### Quotes
> ... human beings do not always discover for themselves clever strategies that they could readily be taught

> ... we must not confuse learned strategies with built-in properties of the underlying biological system

From the above I extrapolate and speculate why people were so optimistic about AI in the early days. The early AI was expected to ***learn what humans also need to learn***, such as playing chess. Such AI was often quite successful, i.e., behaved superiorly to humans. Why, then, the struggle of AI later (until data-driven deep models emerged)? Maybe it's because later AI attempted to ***learn what humans don't need to learn***, i.e., innate abilities, such as recognizing a face. This proved to be much more difficult by taking the same early-day AI approaches, e.g., rule-based expert systems. Early-day AI is good at simulating learned strategies but not innate abilities.

Simon also takes the risky view of ignoring the complexity inside a system or a human:
> ... we should not look for great complexity in the laws governing human behavior, in situations where the behavior is truly simple and only its environment is complex.

> **A man, viewed as a behaving system, is quite simple. The apparent complexity of his behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which he finds himself.**

The organization of memory:
> ... hierarchically organized list structures as a basic principle of memory organization.

### 3. The science of design is about strategies to find the desired solution given objectives and constraints
This part of the books mainly describes the scientific ways of defining design beyond an intuition-driven process. Simon's answer is to connect optimization-related work as the scientific manifestation of design because the common goal is searching for a desirable (best, optimal, or satisficing) solution given objectives and constraints.

What's the difference between design and engineering? If both are dealing with "how things ought to be", then what is the division of labor? Is design just about the ideas and engineering execution of such ideas?

#### Quotes
Why was design education absent in "traditional schools"?
> In terms of the prevailing norms, academic respectability calls for subject matter that is intellectually tough, analytic, formalizable, and teachable. In the past, much, if not most, of what we knew about design and about the artificial sciences was intellectually soft, intuitive, and cookbooky. Why would anyone in a university stoop to teach or learn about designing machines or planning market strategies when he could concern himself with solid-state physics? The answer has been clear: he usually wouldn't.

> Ordinary systems of logic---the standard propositional and predicate calculi, say---serve these sciences well.
... but not so much for design.

Satisficing search:
> We satisfice by looking for alternatives in such a way that we can generally find an accessible one after only moderate search

What really decides search time:
> The time required for a search through a haystack for a needle sharp enough to sew with depends on the density of distribution of sharp needles, but not on the total size of the stack.

Search is information gathering:
> (Search processes) can be viewed more generally as processes for gathering information about problem structure that will ultimately be valuable in discovering a problem solution ... information obtained along any particular branch of a search tree may be used in many contexts besides the one in which it was generated.

Representation is solution:
> This view can be extended to all of problem solving---solving a problem simply means representing it so as to make the solution transparent.

Why this chapter?
> We are importing and exporting from one intellectual discipline to another ideas about how a serially organized information-processing system like a man--or a computer, or a complex of men and computers in organized co-operation--solves problems and achieves goals in outer environments of great complexity.

### 4. Complex systems are hierarchic
- Simon draws on many other fields, e.g., biology and physics, to show how complex systems universally have been hierarchic.
- One important property of such hierarchic systems is 'near decomposability'---interactions are also hierarchic. For examples, when two molecules interact with each other, we don't need to worry about how one atom in one molecule interact with another atom in the other molecule.

#### Quotes

Near decomposability:
> A generalization of the notion of near decomposability might be called the "empty world hypothesis"--most things are only weakly connected with most other things; for a tolerable description of reality only a tiny fraction of all possible interactions needs to be taken into account.

State vs. process descriptions:
> "A circle is the locus of all points equidistant from a given point."

> "To construct a circle, rotate a compass with one arm fixed until the other arm has returned to its starting point."

Look at problem solving as state vs. process descriptions:
> ... problem solving requires continual translation between the state and process descriptions of the same complex reality.

Hierarchy is universal:
> My thesis has been that one path to the construction of a nontrivial theory of complex systems is by way of a theory of hierarchy.
