I have been dreading to write about this book, not because I didn't quite finish it, but because it is just so difficult to read and to take away meaningful lessons.

Maybe I should keep this short because I don't think I am really qualified to comment that much on a book I don't quite understand.

The thesis is that technological advances, in the form of "media", influence individuals and society in ways that more profound that what those technologies were created for in the first place. 
Amongst the many examples mentioned in the book, I remember one about how the invention of writing and printing enabled people to send messages to one another, which in turn led to the popularization of roads and further the decentralization of cities and towns.

Many technological advances often lead to fragmentation, such as creating more specific jobs, leading to a more divisive societal structure.

I could try to recall more about what I learned from this book but, frankly speaking, there is little.
I trust that this book is a classic, as endorsed by many others.
But it is just not accessible to me.
I find it really difficult to read and I don't think a book has to be written that way to be a classic.
I strongly believe the author could have written about same set of ideas in a more straightforward, plainer, read-friendlier language.
I don't understand why that wasn't the choice.
It's a shame that such great ideas have to stay buried under often cryptic and obscure text.
