One of the very few books that made a simple yet powerful idea known to the world and produced profound impact.

From arranging food items on a local restaurant menu to asking citizens to opt-out rather than opt-in financial plans, the way we let people make choices (called "Choice Architecture" in the book) often significantly affects how they make choices, sometimes as much as their own will. 

On the other hand, due to poor user-centered thinking, many tasks that will benefit people are often made ridiculously difficult (e.g., filling out a bunch of paperwork and standing in line for a long time to get vaccinated). This is aptly called "Sludge". I think, in the real world, sometimes it is more important to eliminate Sludges then employing Nudges.
