I packed this book on my 2024 trip to Asia because it's recommended as one of the best short books to read.

It did not disappoint.

The book is a collection of Haruki Murakami's journals/diaries between 2005 and 2006 where he talks about his experience of running, focusing on how he trained for a Marathon and a Triathlon.

I really enjoyed reading this journal/diary style of writing. Colloquial. Honest. Unpretentious. Down to earth.

As many reviews suggest, the books is about running but also more than running.
It certainly impressed a strong image of Murakami, in his 50's, so stubbornly and almost religiously run day after day, despite the busyness of his career, the physical pain, and the occasional frustration.

But beyond running, what you see is a simple and purposeful lifestyle. 
Murakami's life consists of writing and running and very little of anything else. 
His motivation behind such life-long activities is not purely a matter of being good at them.
Of course, he's a really successful writer.
But, when it comes to running, he's only a very good amateur.
The force that drives him to keep running and running for decades seems much deeper than becoming good at running (or to stay fit so he can keep writing, as he mentioned in the book). 
It almost feels like a mission bestowed upon him, no questions asked.
Also, his writing hints a little bit of some constant dissatisfaction about his body.
It feels like he wants to keep challenging his body's ability to run with a strong belief that it will if he keeps running.

That, to me, might be a way of life that is more than about running.

Finally, one maybe amusing thing: I didn't realize he's the famous 村上 春樹 until maybe half way into the book.
The English spelling of his name did not ring any bell. Nor was the picture on the back of the book.
Well, at least that means I genuinely enjoys this book, not because it was written by the famous Haruki Murakami.
