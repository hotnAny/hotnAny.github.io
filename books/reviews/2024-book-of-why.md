Earlier this year, I decided to read "the Book of Why" for the second time, mainly because I didn't believe that I sufficiently understood it and took away from the first reading. When I read it the first time, I was a little taken by surprise because the level of difficulty was higher than I had anticipated in a non-fiction book. I have to admit I rushed through parts of it rather impatiently. For the second time, I wanted to read it the right way: slowly and trying to understand as much as I can.

The approach of reading was simple: I spent 20-40 minutes every night on almost every weekday reading the book. Overall, besides being able to learn and re-learn lots of things (the most gain is in the chapter of paradoxes), compared to other books that democratize academic research (e.g., "the Alignment Problem"), "the Book of Why" is mildly stubborn in keeping certain academic characteristics, such as many usages of equations and certain paragraphs that do not sacrifice specific details for understandability.

Did I have a more systemic take-away for the 2nd reading? Not really. The main joy mostly stemmed from the ability to delve into certain chapters and understand the contents more deeply and more naturally (i.e., not forcing myself to do so). Similar to the first time, I developed a tendency to imagine causal diagram in my mind when encountering related issues (mostly user studies in HCI, which, unfortunately can benefit quite little from causality due to its highly controlled style). Perhaps it would be great to have some interactive tools for readers to put what they learn in this book into actions.
