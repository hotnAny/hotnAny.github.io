I listened to the audiobook version of Benjamin Franklin: An American Life by Walter Isaacson.

I've long been a fan of Isaacson’s work, beginning with his biography of Elon Musk. I also recall hearing on a podcast how profoundly this book on Franklin impacted one of the guests—a sentiment I now understand firsthand.

I found myself resonating deeply with Franklin. We seem to share a mindset: a persistent drive toward self-improvement. Much of Franklin’s writing reflects his lifelong commitment to bettering himself as a person. One example that stood out was his experiment with frugality—he once tried subsisting on just bread and water for dinner and the following breakfast. His conclusion? It was entirely manageable, reinforcing his belief that a simple, frugal lifestyle was both sustainable and virtuous.

Another compelling aspect was Franklin’s dedication to science and invention. He continually pursued experiments, including his famous kite experiment demonstrating the electrical nature of lightning. Even during his transatlantic voyages, he found ways to devise and conduct experiments. Unlike Edison, Franklin didn’t appear motivated by financial gain. In fact, he chose not to patent many of his inventions. What drove him was an innate curiosity and a desire to better understand the world.

Franklin "retired" at a relatively young age, though his post-retirement life was anything but idle. I found this portion of the book a bit more fragmented—perhaps a reflection of the diverse and sprawling nature of his later activities. Still, one clear thread emerged: his active involvement in critical political and diplomatic efforts during the founding of the United States, right up until the end of his life.

In the end, I agree with Isaacson’s portrayal of Franklin as an embodiment of the American ideal—a model citizen of the new republic, demonstrating how one can continually strive for personal growth while also contributing to the greater good.
