This book is one of Tim Ferriss' many classics that are packed with radical yet practical tips and recipes for out-of-your-imagination achievements.
As the title indicates, this one is mainly about "hacking" your body.

I believe I am already taking quite good care of my body so didn't expect to have much room for improvement. Still, I felt I gained a lot from this book, both from its contents and the way it is presented.

Content-wise, the most useful lesson for me is the "slow carb" technique, whose basic principle is to simply eat lots of protein and no carb most of the time with one cheat day per week. 
Some skeptics might say this just sounds like Keto with fat replaced by protein.
There other differences too (based on my interpretation), such as the goal of consuming protein to build muscles, which in turn increases the metabolic rate to help you consume calories.
"Slow carb" also encourages over-consuming anything you'd like to eat on the cheat day, which also helps reminding your body that you are supposed to burn this much calories per day.
Finally, there is really no portion control. The general principle is to eat a lot. The belief is that you need to consume enough calories from non-carb sources to not crave for carb and in the long run transform what you intrinsically feel like eating.

I quasi-adopted the "slow carb" technique because I didn't completely abandon carb for six days a week. I still eat quite some portion of fruits and occasionally sugary snacks (but very few). I also cheated on both days of the weekends, although I never overconsumed like the author suggests in the book. The effect? I didn't lose significant amount of weight but I feel my weight stabilizes a lot more. Gradually, I also don't feel like snacking or hungary between meals, probably because I stick to eating three nutritious meals. Spiritually, I feel like food no longer controls me that much and my happiness depends much less on eating. The reason might be, via executing the "slow carb" technique, I have been taking an increasingly functional view of eating---that is, when I eat, I am not that bothered by the tastiness of the food but rather concerned more about the function of eating certain food (e.g., protein builds muscle and greens bring in fibre and nutrients).

Besides "slow carb", I also adopted the book's recommended Kettlebell and ab exercise. I still yet to experience any noticeable changes to my body.

Finally, I apprieciate how the author structures the book to be like a buffet where you can easily jump from chapter to chapter to sample its contents. The author even made some "menus" for you---which chapters you should read based on your needs. I believe every book should support such a buffet-like reading experience.
