I read this book when ChatGPT and DALL-E were everything everyone wants to talk about. The idea that you don't need to do the actual work to make creative contents is thrilling.

We are in over our head to assume AI can make us creative and this book can save us.

The book follows the author's life chronologically, documenting his developing philosophy as a professional furniture maker. Overall, it is a great read (I skimmed). It is surprisingly philosophical and abstract coming from someone who make pragmatic, physical things. At times, I wonder how many readers have reached the height of making that allows them to understand the author's philosophy.

(Some of the following quotes are actually from others than the author.)

> Who knows what from the forward momentum of life will take the time ahead or what use it will make of our anguished searching. The most that any one of us can seem to do is to fashion something---an object or ourselves--and drop it into the confusion, make an offering of it, so to speak, to the life force. --- Ernest Becker, The Denial of Death.

The last sentence in the Introduction:
> ... creative effort is a process of challenging embedded narratives of belief in order to think the world into being for oneself, and that the work involved in doing so provides a wellspring of spiritual fulfillment.

The author teaches laymen makers
> What lures them is the hope of finding a deeper meaning by learning to make things well with their own hands.

What often strikes me about making physical things is how it does not allow for iterations. You've got to execute every step *right*. You can't make a crappy chair and improve it in a second iteration (unless you count trashing the old one re-making a new one as iteration). Maybe because the author has perfected the art so well that iteration is not needed.

The following resonates with my obsession of wanting to be good at making things---it builds some quality that is unattainable in other activities like writing.
> ... even so simple an operation so simple as cutting a mortise harmonizes intellect, manual skill, and character in a way that underscores the artificiality of the Cartesion divide between mind and body.
> "A potter is one of the few people left who uses his natural faculties of heart, head and hand in balance--the whole man"

Being able to manually control a thing and interact with its environment extends a human's senses and abilities
> The boat becomes a live thing in my hand, but more than that, it is as if my sense extend throughout the boat--until water, wind, and sky are all there is. Skilled woodworking is like that. My consciousness comes to inhabit the tip of the knife and the tooth of the saw, so that I am not only in the world, but somehow of the world.

What does craftsmanship mean? Doing X for the joy of doing X, nothing else.
> Richard Sennet defines craftsmanship as "learning to do something well, for its own sake"

The author sees through Csikszentmihalyi's nine elements of flow and pinpoints that only the first three matter (the rest are just descriptive but not prescriptive):
> 1. There are clear goals every step of the way
> 2. There is immediate feedback to one's actions
> 3. There is a balance between challenge and skills

The magic of making that happens to makers:
> They seem to relive him of the felt need to offer chattering *interpretation* of himself to vindicate his worth. He can simply point: the building stands, the car now runs, the lights are on. ... craftsmanship must reckon with the infallible judgment of reality, where one's failures or shortcomings cannot be interpreted away.

Three aspects of thinking with things
> Discovery is the process of coming up with new ideas and implementing them, decision by decision. Embodiment is the way in which the constructed desk cast my decisions in concrete-became what the painter Chuck Close has referred to as the frozen detritus of the artist's experience. Communication is what happens when the desk registers on the consciousness of a respondent.

What the authors intends to make is not just furniture but also himself
> I used to describe my aesthetic goals as a furniture maker--integrity, simplicity, and grace--also described the person I sought to grow into through the practice of craftsmanship.
