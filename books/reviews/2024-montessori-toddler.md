I started reading this book because 1) I like the idea of raising my kids the Montessori way and 2) I found it difficult to grasp the gist of what Montessori really is.

After reading this book, I am quite confident that I can now practice the Montessori way habitually with my kid; however, it still seems hard for me to say Montessori is really just about X, Y, and Z.

Still, I should try---the Montessori way is about creating an environment that allows a child to take the lead and hands-on explore the rich objects and experiences in the world.

Let me try to unpack a few terms:

- The environment includes both the physical environment (e.g., organizing toys in separate trays) and the emotional environment (e.g., acknowledging their feelings when they are upset and throwing a tantrum).
- "Take the lead" means not telling the child what to do (even with their best interest in mind) but instead let them decide what to do and how to do it as much as possible. As parents, our job is to observe and encourage their exploration.
- "Exploration" seems a very common activity for toddlers, which includes playing with leaves in the park and messing with food on the table. Understanding their needs to explore the world can help us respond to their behaviors more appropriately.

Another way to "get" Montessori is try to do a few things the Montessori way. I find it a constant challenge to do these few things right but hopefully the 20/80 rule applies here---these few things would play a quite important role in developing the Montessori system.

1. **Try not to say "no" to your child**. One common strategy is to negate your "no-sentence". For example, "don't put your foot on the table" would be "keep your foot under the table". However, sometimes you just instinctively yell "no" outright or sometimes you'd find it hard or awkward to flip the no-sentence.

2. **Help your child as much as needed but as little as possible**. It's hard to find the balance between not helping and helping, as well as when to help. It's even harder when you are running short on time, such as when the child insists on dressing themselves on a weekday morning.

3. **Understand and acknowledge their feeling**. The impulse seems to correct them with the "right" feeling, e.g., "you shouldn't be so rude to that kind", whereas the Montessori way would start by trying to understand their feeling behind such rudeness and acknowledge our understanding.

I don't think the above lists are really perfect or complete to encapsulate what Montessori is. I read this book very slowly (about one page per day) in order to maximize the time it makes contact with my child-caring days. Maybe such a slow reading subtly imbued Montessori inside me without alerting me to recognize its distinguishable characteristics.

Another fun thing I did during reading this book was making those 4x2 index cards. I had about 100 of them, each a nugget I took away from the book
