I started reading this book because 1) I like the idea of raising my kinds the Montessori way and 2) I found it difficult to grasp the gist of what Montessori really is.

After reading this book, I am quite confident that I can now practice the Montessori way habitually with my kid; however, it still seems hard for me to say Montessori is really just about X, Y, and Z.

Still, I should try---the Montessori way is about creating an environment that allows a child to take the lead and hands-on explore the rich objects and experiences in the world.

Let me try to unpack a few terms:

- The environment includes both the physical environment (e.g., organizing toys in separate trays) and the emotional environment (e.g., acknowledging their feelings when they are upset and throw a tantrum).
- "Take the lead" means not telling the child what to do (even with their best interest in mind) but instead let them decide what to do and how to do it as much as possible. As parents, our job is to observe and encourage their exploration.
- "Exploration" seems a very common activity for toddlers, which includes playing with leaves in the park and messing with food on the table. Understanding their needs to explore the world can help us respond to their behaviors more appropriately.

I don't think the above list is really perfect or complete to encapsulate what Montessori is. I read this book very slowly (about one page per day) in order to maximize the time it makes contact with my child-caring days. Maybe such a slow reading subtly imbued Montessori inside me without alerting me to recognize its distinguishable characteristics.

Another fun thing I did during reading this book was making those 4x2 index cards. I had about 100 of them, each a nugget I took away from the book
