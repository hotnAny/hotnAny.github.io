<!-- 2023-7-principles-of-fat-burning -->

Written by Dr. Berg, who is not a medical doctor but a "doctor of chiropractic degree", this book looks at fat-burning from a hormonal perspective. The main thesis is that not all calories are equal---when consuming the right kind of calories while stimulating the right kind of fat-burning hormones, one can effectively burn fat.

One should notice that the audience of this book is (implied to be) obese people who have a lot of fat to burn. There is no mentioning of fat-burning for people who are just overweight or quite fit.

There are several points that I disagree with, such as intermittent fasting is bad because it breaks down muscle and causes hunger later to consume more. The truth should be that intermittent fasting breaks down both fat and muscle, the latter of which can be rebuilt via exercises and protein. The "causing hunger" argument is self-defeating as the author argues elsewhere that being hungry for the right kinds of calorie (i.e., not carb) is okay.

# The 7 Principles

1. **There are four different body shapes, each influenced by hormones**
    - One key insight is that not all obesity are equal. The author categorizes four types based on causes: adrenal, ovary, thyroid, and liver;

2. **Calories are insignificant compared to fat-burning hormones**
    - The author thinks it's wrong to assume that fat-burning is simply using more calories than consumed;
    - The author objects to a low-calorie diet to burn fat because it will eventually stimulate hunger and cause "rebound";

3. **You have to be healthy before you can lose weight**
    - This is not a surprising viewpoint considering the intended audience are obese, which are unhealthy;

4. **Environmental hormones and chemicals mimic your hormones**
    - This point is about avoid eating food that comes with the wrong kinds of hormones, e.g., farm-raised chicken containing growth hormones;

5. **You have to heal your glands and hormones to keep the weight off**
    - A natural point following up the previous one on hormones;

6. **Fat-burning and fat-storing hormones have their own triggers**
    - Example 1: "... correct exercise might work if you can get seven hours of quality sleep per night, whereas poor or inadequate sleep will prevent fat burning";
    - Example 2: "... just a little bit of sweet carbohydrate can set your fat burning back for a day";
    - Example 3: "... drinking wine at night, as alcohol is a gland (liver) destroyer and can set back fat burning for hours or days";

7. **Incorrect exercise prevents fat burning**
    - If stress causes your obesity then intense exercise won't burn fat because it also adds to your stress;

# Key Quotes

On our body storing fat
> ... [fat] is a survival mechanism, and the body will not let go of fat until the source of stress or the threat to survival is gone--in other words, until the body is healthy.

On fat-storing vs. fat-burning hormones
> You have roughly 600 hormone keys. Of this number, six are fat burning and three are fat storing. If any of the three fat-storing hormones are active they will nullify ALL six fat burning hormones. The secret is to activate the six and keep the three inactive.

On the importance of not having sugar reserves in order to burn fat
> Adipose tissue is only used when absolutely necessary---after the sugar fuel has been exhausted. The body *always* uses stored sugar or dietary sugar as a priority before tapping into fat fuel. This is the principal reason why people are not losing weight. Most of them are running their bodies on sugar fuel. You must deplete your sugar reserves BEFORE you can tap into your fat reserves.

One exercises for burning fat
> ... it's not the calories burned during exercise that are significant. It's the delayed fat-burning peaks that occur between 14 and 48 hours later---but only if specific conditions are correct in regard to sleep and stress levels.

An important point about cholesterol
> ... when dietary intake of cholesterol foods is high, the body will make less, and when dietary cholesterol intake is low, the body will make more. This explains why many people still have high cholesterol despite consuming less of it.

On fat as body parts
> ... a good portion of your bdy is made of fat---brain, nerves, hormones and glands. Your body is constantly replacing these tissues with dietary fats.
