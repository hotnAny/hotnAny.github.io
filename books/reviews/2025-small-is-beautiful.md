This is an idealist's book.

The main thesis argues that the modern economy primarily aims to maximize profits, while neglecting other equally important objectives. In other words---
> ... something is uneconomic when it fails to earn an adequate profit in terms of money. The method of economics does not, and cannot, produce any other meaning.

In contrast, the author advocates for a different philosophy---
> Gandhi's economics started (and finished) with people, with their need for strong morale and their desire to be self-determining---objectives which headlong development can only thwart.

<!-- > The illusion of unlimited powers, nourished by astonishing scientific and technological achievements, has produced the concurrent illusion of having solved the problem of production. The latter illusion is based on the failure to distinguish between income and capital. -->

## People Matter

The economics of the past often disregarded those who needed it the most.
> The conventional wisdom of what is now taught as economics by-passes the poor, the very people for whom development is really needed. The economics of giantism and automation is a left-over of nineteenth-century conditions and nineteenth-century thinking and it is totally incapable of solving any of the real problems of today.

In other words, as the subtitle of the book suggests, the author advocates for a different approach to economics—"as if people mattered." The author argues it is flawed to treat economics as though it were a natural science like physics:
> The great majority of economics is still pursuing the absurd ideal of making their "science" as scientific and precise as physics, as if there were no qualitative difference between mindless atoms and men made in the image of God.

This perspective is still relevant today, particularly in the age of AI:
> The economic calculus, as applied by present-day economics, forces the industrialist to eliminate the human factor because machines do not make mistakes, which people do.

## The More Work, the Better?

The book references Buddhism to explain why we shouldn't strive to maximize the amount of work done by an individual---
> The Buddhist sees the essence of civilization not in a multiplication of wants but in the purification of human character. Character, at the same time, is formed primarily by a man's work. And work, properly conducted in conditions of human dignity and freedom, blesses those who do it and equally their products.

This quote resonates with my long-held belief that increasing productivity does not necessarily lead to more happiness. A more productive worker may spend less time on the same tasks, but this often results in taking on more work—sometimes even leisure (as emails ping us on every device)—increasing overall work.

## Consumption is Not the Goal

The following argument really struck me. I call it the "maximizing happiness while minimizing consumption" principle:
> ... the modern economist ... is used to measuring the "standard of living" by the amount of annual consumption, assuming all the time that a man who consumes more is "better off" than a man who consumes less. A Buddhist economist would consider this approach excessively irrational: since consumption is merely a means to human well-being, the aim should be to obtain the maximum of well-being with the minimum of consumption.

## Man vs. Mankind

The book points out the need to think beyond the individual when addressing issues that concern all of humanity. This spirit forms the backbone of the book's thesis:
> In the affairs of men, there always appears to be a need for at least two things simultaneously, which, on the face of it, seem to be incompatible and to exclude one another. We always need both freedom and order. ... When it comes to action, we obviously need small units, because action is a highly personal affair, and one cannot be in touch with more than a very limited number of persons at any one time. But when it comes to the world of ideas, to principles or to ethics, to the indivisibility of peace and also of ecology, we need to recognise the unity of mankind and base our actions upon this recognition.


Overall, this book offers an idealistic philosophy on what the world of economics should be. While I am unsure if today's economy has overcome the issues the book discusses, and whether such an idealistic world is achievable, the book leaves little in terms of actionable takeaways to bring about change.
