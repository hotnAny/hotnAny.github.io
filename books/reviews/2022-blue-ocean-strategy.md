This book preaches Blue Ocean Strategy--developing features of a product that are so significantly new and different from the competitors' that there will be no competition.

This strategy contrasts the Red Ocean approaches where you compete with existing players in well-established standards, i.e., producing the same features better than the others.

The book doesn't differentiate blue vs. red ocean companies; instead, any company can take either strategy.
> ... the strategic move, and not the company or the industry, is the right unit of analysis for explaining the creation of blue oceans and sustained high performance.

Value Innovation:
> Value innovation is the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy. We call it value innovation because instead of focusing on beating the competition, you focus on making the competition irrelevant by creating a leap in value for buyers and your company, thereby opening up new and uncontested market space.

The [[strategy canvas | https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/tools/strategy-canvas/]] is a useful tool:
- the X axis ('competing factors') consists of dimensions along which products compete, e.g., low price, fun and humor, friendly service, and speed;
- the Y axis is the achievement, or score, i.e., how good each product is on each dimension;
- the goal is to define new space on the X axis (hence no competition) while being willing to sacrifice (lowering) existing factors that don't matter that much;

What makes a good strategy canvas:
- Focus: it needs to focus on specific new competing factors;
- Divergence: (overall) it needs to be significantly different from red ocean players;
- Compelling tagline: the innovation should be easy to describe in simple language;

Tech != value (not always):
> They acted on the assumption that bleeding-edge technology is equivalent to bleeding-edge utility for buyers--something that, our research found, is rarely the case.

About pricing:
> ... a company should start with the strategic price and then deduct its desired profit margin from the price to arrive at the target cost. Here, price-minus costing, and not cost-plus pricing, is essential ...

Blue ocean business model:
> A business model built in the sequence of exceptional utility, strategic pricing, and target costing produces value innovation.
