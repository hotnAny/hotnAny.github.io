I haven't read any reviews or critics' comments on the author's work but I guess the main challenge would be a lack of experiments or validation of the proposed framework. If this framework is *the* answer to the intelligence question, why shouldn't we already have already implemented such intelligence?

I disagree with the author that artificial neural networks (ANNs) totally avoid any principles of how human brains work. I think ANNs probably do a pretty good job simulating some low-level structure of our brain, e.g., how layers of neurons together (as a "column", using this book's term) can recognize images. But the problem is that our brain is much more than that in the sense that such structure is merely a microscopic building block of a much more complex, unknown mechanism in our brain that makes us intelligent.

Does AI have to mimic the brain to be truly intelligent? This remains a philosophical argument until someone actually re-invents intelligence. Although the author firmly believes so, one can easily find counter-examples, such as how airplanes successfully achieves flying without fully mimicking birds (no flapping wings).

The kind of intelligence discussed in this book (or maybe also the predecessor "On Intelligence") remains narrow, mainly limited to recognizing objects and places. How about the intelligence of solving math problems, the intelligence of creating art, or the intelligence of empathizing with another human being?

I do find the visioning of intelligent systems exploring the vast universe fascinating. At the time I read this chapter, I just finished "Existential Physics" that really piqued my interest wanting to know the "secrets' of the universe. However, I didn't put together such interest and AI until seeing Hawkins' proposal. It also reminds me of how the famous sci-fi story about a machine calculated "42" as the answer to the "ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything".
