I had quite a high expectation of Richard Koch after hearing Tim Ferriss speaking so highly of him.
I even stocked up a few of Koch's books in my shopping cart.
Then I decided to listen to this book as it is probably his most famous one.

I am sorry that I had to quit after just a few chapters.

The main reason is that I find it hard to listen to the same principle being said, paraphrased, or otherwise interpreted over and over again.
I grew sick of hearing the phrase "the 80/20 principle".
I understand such a repetition is inevitable when writing an entire book about a principle that one could explain in one sentence.
I don't know any other better way to write such a book without boring the reader so I don't really blame the author for this.

The secondary reason is perhaps about this book's focus on business.
The author had experiences working in consulting companies, which might have significantly influenced his style of writing.
Unfortunately, I am not a business person and can't really judge or appreciate this kind of business-oriented writing.
For a different reader, such as those who read Blue Ocean Strategy, they might find this book engaging and informative.
