I think one should read this book as a bible. Study it. Return to it from time to time. Refresh one's spirituality via reading it.

This two-part book consists of 1) an account of the author's experience in the concentration camp and 2) discussions of legotherapy. The first half is the empirical foundation of the latter that man ought to search for the meaning of his life.

I believe most readers should take away with a new light on understanding one's "suffering", most likely incomparable to what the author had gone through. If Frankl could stick to the meaning of his life through that kind of suffering, why can't you yours?

It might seem that the first half is a never-ending list of memory pieces and one might be eagerly looking for some preaching that gives you "the answer" to life's meaning. But that's not what the author attempts to achieve. He believes his story should motivate you to find out your own meaning of life, which will in turn empower you through suffering in your life.

It reminds me of a professor I met in college. He was one of the few "foreign professors" who came from the US. He had a very unusual way of teaching, such as being angry at a student at the right time for the right reason. But what truly imprinted him in my memory was once he spoke of his search for life's "mission" (or "meaning"--can't remember the exact word). He said that he only found it in his sixties despite going through multiple quite successful career paths, i.e., teaching at top universities. He then told us to keep looking. What he implied was that, compared to him, we were too young to give up because we were currently lost.

## Quotes
On how success should ensue rather than be pursued.
> For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. ... success will follow you precisely because you had *forgotten* to think of it.

On how love transcends the beloved.
> Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self. Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance.

On how humans perceive suffering.
> ... a man's suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the "size" of human suffering is absolutely relative.

On the tension between life's goal and man's mission to fulfill it.
> What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chose task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him. What man needs is not homeostasis but what I call "noÃ¶dynamics," i.e., the existential dynamics in a polar field of tension where one pole is represented by a meaning that is to be fulfilled and the other pole by the man who has to fulfill it.

On leveraging the transitoriness of life:
> Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now.

On one's responsibility to search for the meaning of life:
> It is we ourselves who must answer the questions that life asks of us, and to these questions we can respond only by being responsible for our existence.
