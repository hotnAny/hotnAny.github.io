## One Sentence
The three authors summarize 10 challenges for the future of computer-aided design (CAD) tools in computational geometry, interaction techniques and scale.

## Key Points
#### Descriptive geometry
>"... descriptive geometry, primarily using second-desgree algebraic equations, to provide more precise mathematical descriptions and increase accuracy and precision in engineering drawings."

#### On NASA's catalog of airfoil shapes
> "Design could now begin with curves known a priori to have properties needed for a viable design"
> "At this point, geometry began changing from describing a physical object to becoming the base for calculating engineering characteristics."

#### Shape control
> "Shape control defines the occurrence and position of inflection points (points at which the signed curvature of a planar curve changes)."

On allowing designers to test their designs early
> "... it would be more efficient if technology existed that allowed preliminary tests on the desktop or even on PDs. Designers could then catch bad designs much earlier in the process. This would also help them discover, explore, refine, and understand the most promising designs as early in the process as possible."

#### Designers and their work should be linked automatically by matching the work's nature
> "... linking designers' efforts must be linked automatically as a consequence of undertaking a particular activity"

#### Object-oriented modeling
> "In this object-oriented process, designers generally do more than just select components and plug them into a larger assembly. Rather, they take components and transform them into what is needed."
> "Embedded in the component catalog, therefore, are just not the parts, but the knolwedge of how parts can be transformed."

#### The "long nose" effect
> "The National Academy of Science recenlty released a report that studied the genesis of a large number of technologies, including graphical user interfaces, portable communication, relational databases, and so on. For each, it looked at how long that technology took to get from discovery to a $1 billion industry. The average was about 20 years. This suggests that any technologies that are going to have impact over the next 10 years are already known and have probably been known for at least 10 years."
> "The engineering of significantly better products should come from fresh insights on what is already known or knowable."
