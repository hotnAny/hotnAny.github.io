# Power to the people: The role of humans in interactive machine learning

## One Sentence
This article presents several case studies to advocate the approach of interactive machine learning that involve humans in a rapid, focused and incremental manner.

## Key Points
People Naturally Want to Provide More Than Just Data Labels:
> "The authors found that people naturally provided a wide variety of input types to improve the classifierâ€™s performance, including suggesting alternative features to use, adjusting the importance or weight given to different features, and modifying the information extracted from the text. These results present an opportunity to develop new machine-learning algorithms that might better support the natural feedback people want to provide to learners, rather than force users to interact in limited, learner-centered ways."
