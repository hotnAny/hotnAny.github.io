# Did You Mean Compare or Correlate? Identifying Intent in Visual Analytical Conversations



## One Sentence

* This paper is about mapping intent to different visualizations and the transitions in between.

## More Sentences
* The Wizard-of-Oz study was based on a 2x2 of four conditions: (w/, w/o intent) x (w/, w/o context).
** W/ intent means the wizard will manipulate the visualization to meet the user's intent; w/o intent means the visualization will follow prescribed rules (rather than reacting to users' intent);
** W/ context means an utterance will be interpreted with its context (whenever possible); w/o context means each utterance will be interpreted independently.

## Key Points
Literature
> "Existing literature about intent deduction can be classified into two categories: intent for search in information retrieval systems and intent for analytical tasks in visualization systems."

The information retrieval side:
> "Broder introduced a high level taxonomy of search intent by categorizing search queries into three categories: navigational, informational and transactional"

The visual analytics side:
> "... none of these systems attempt to infer user intent; they rely either on data characteristics alone or on explicit task descriptions that can be cumbersome to create."
