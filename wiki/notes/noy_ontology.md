## One Sentence

## Key Points
#### What is ontology?
> "...––explicit formal specifications of the terms in the domain and relations among them ..."
> "... an ontology is a formal explicit description of concepts in a domain of discourse"

#### Other concepts of ontology
* **Classes** (sometimes called **concepts**: a domain of discourse;
* **Slots** (sometimes **roles** or **properties**): properties of each class describing various features and attributes of the concept;
* **Facets** (sometimes **role restrictions**): restrictions on slots;
* **Knowledge base** = an ontology + a set of individual **instances** of class

#### Why develop and ontology?
> * To share common understanding of the structure of information among people or software agents
> * To enable reuse of domain knowledge
> * To make domain assumption explicit
> * To separate domain knowledge from the operational knowledge
> * To analyze domain knowledge

#### How is ontology different from Object-Oriented Programming
> "Object-oriented programming centers primarily around methods on classes––a programmer makes design decisions based on the operational properties of a class, whereas an ontology designer makes these decisions based on the structural properties of a class. As a result, a class structure and relations among classes in an ontology are different from the structure for a similar domain in an object-oriented program."

#### Basic steps to develop an ontology
> * defining classes in the ontology,
> * arranging the classes in a taxonomic (subclass-superclass) hierachy,
> * defining slots and describing allowed values for these slots,
> * filling in the values for slots for instances.
