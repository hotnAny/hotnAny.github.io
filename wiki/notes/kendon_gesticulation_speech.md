## Key Points
Gesticulation:
> "These movements may become complex and exensive and they are generally recognized as being intimately linked to the activity of speaking and are often regarded as part of the speaker's total expression. These hand and arm movements, here to be referred to as *gesticulation*"

An overview of the relationship between speech and gesticulation
> "Speech and movement appear together, as manifestations of the same proess of utterance. That is, in the translation of 'ideas' into observable behavior which may be read by others as being reportive of those ideas, the output that resultrs is manifested in both speech and movement."

The temporal relationship between gestures and speech
> "In gesticulation we see patterns of moment that are enactive or depictive of the ideas being expressed, yet such expressions are concurrent with, indeed they often somewhat precede, verbal expression."

Condon and Ogston (1966, 1967b)
> "Its principal significance for our present concern is that it shows that the individual, in speakinug, acts as a whole, that speech is not a disjunct action system but that is continuously mobilizes the muscular systems of the whole body."

Speech's four levels of organization:
* Locution (words and phrases that make up complete sentences)
* Locution Groups
* Locution Clusters (equivalent to paragraphs)
* Discourse (highest level)

Gesticulation's organization:
* The basic unit is called a "a phrase of gesticulation, or *G-Phrase*"
* A G-Phrase starts and ends at rest positions, and is distinguished in the "excrusionary movement in which the limb, or part of it, shows a distinct peaking of *effort*", or "a moment of accented movement" called *stroke*
* A G-Phrase starts at *rest position*, go through *preparation*, *stroke*, *recovery/return* to rest position.
