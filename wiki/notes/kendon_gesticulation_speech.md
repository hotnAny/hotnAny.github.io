## One Sentence

## Key Points
Gesticulation:
> "These movements may become complex and exensive and they are generally recognized as being intimately linked to the activity of speaking and are often regarded as part of the speaker's total expression. These hand and arm movements, here to be referred to as *gesticulation*"

An overview of the relationship between speech and gesticulation
> "Speech and movement appear together, as manifestations of the same proess of utterance. That is, in the translation of 'ideas' into observable behavior which may be read by others as being reportive of those ideas, the output that resultrs is manifested in both speech and movement."

The temporal relationship between gestures and speech
> "In gesticulation we see patterns of moment that are enactive or depictive of the ideas being expressed, yet such expressions are concurrent with, indeed they often somewhat precede, verbal expression."

> "... the stroke of the G-Phrase is completed either before the Tone Unit nucleus, or just at its onset."

> "The temporal priority of gesgture may partly be due to the fact that for a given idea to be expressed in words it must be strung out in time, whereas the same idea may be expressed in gesture within a single movement or pose of the hand."

Condon and Ogston (1966, 1967b)
> "Its principal significance for our present concern is that it shows that the individual, in speakinug, acts as a whole, that speech is not a disjunct action system but that is continuously mobilizes the muscular systems of the whole body."

Speech's four levels of organization:
* Locution (complete sentences)
* Locution Groups
* Locution Clusters (equivalent to paragraphs)
* Discourse (highest level)

Gesticulation's organization:
* The basic unit is called a "a phrase of gesticulation, or *G-Phrase*"
* A G-Phrase starts and ends at rest positions, and is distinguished in the "excrusionary movement in which the limb, or part of it, shows a distinct peaking of *effort*", or "a moment of accented movement" called *stroke*
* A G-Phrase starts at *rest position*, go through *preparation*, *stroke*, *recovery/return* to rest position.

Observation:
* Locution clusters contrast each other with distinct gesticulations
* "... each Locution is associated with a distinctive unit of gesticulatory activity"
* "... there were 26 Tone Units, twenty of these had a corresponding G-Phrase. Of the other six Tone Units, three, occuring in succession, shared a single G-Phrase ..."

Gesticulation as an alternate expression of ideas
> "... in terms of the phrasal organization of the gesticulation a distinct phrase of gesticulation is produed for each unit of meaning or 'idea unit' the utterer deals with"
> "This means that the phrases of gesticulation that co-occur with speech are not to be thought of either as mere embellishments of expression or as by-products of the speech process. They are, rather, an alternate manifestation of the process by which 'ideas' are encoded into patterns of behavior which can be apprehended by others as *reportive* of those ideas."

Gestures are not by-products of speech (evidence)
> "The appearance of G-Phrases somewhat in advance of the appearance of speech phrases with which they are associated means, of course, that the G-Phrase must have been organized at least at the same time, if not a little in advance of its associated speech phrase. Thus the G-Phrase must be seen as originating simultaneously with the origination of speech and not as a product of the speech production process."
