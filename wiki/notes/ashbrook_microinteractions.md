## One Sentence
The author proposed a concept of 'microinteraction' with mobile/wearable devices--"single-purpose interactions ... that take a very short amount of time", from making a phone call, to checking emails, to replying a text message.

## Key Points
* "Often, would-be microinteractions are surrounded by 'setup' and 'teardown' interactions that serve only to prepare the device for the microinteraction." This dissertation proposes using wearable devices to reduce both setup and teardown time.

* "There are two categories these applications can be divided into: 1. User initiating ... 2. User responding ..."

## Thoughts
* Aren't all mobile/wearable interactions microinteractions?
* Setup and teardown seems a nice way to tease out the problem but what about the things that happen in between? For example, text entry on mobile/wearable devices clearly slows down some microinteractions. So is the problem of small screens, which causes "fat finger" problem (input) and makes it hard to retrieve information (output). Any solutions for improvement? Intrinsically, there should be better interaction techniques address mobile/wearable's limitations; extrinsically, there should be additional I/O mechanism (e.g., voice input) to ease the existing interaction.
