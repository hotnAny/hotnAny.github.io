## One Sentence
This paper describes a framework for jointly interpreting multimodal input signals by merging semantic frames, and maintaining context by merging temporally adjacent frames

## Key Points
> "Human communication is very natural and flexible because we can take advantage of a multiplicity of communication signals working in concert to supply complementary information or increase robustness with redundancy"
