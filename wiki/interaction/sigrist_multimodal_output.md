## One Sentence
This paper reviews different modalities of feedback (visual, audio, haptic and a combination of more than one of them) and how it affects different types, aspects and stages of motor learning

## Terminologies
* **Augmented feedback**, "also known as extrinsic feedback", is defined as information that cannot be elaborated without an external source; thus, it is provided by a trainer or a display"

* "... **hapic** refers to both tactile and kinesthetic perception:

  * "Tactile perception is usually conveyed through the skin, such as by vibrations or pressure;
  * "kinesthetic perception refers to receptors in muscles and tendons that allow us to feel the pose of our body"

* "**Motor learning** describes a lasting change of motor performance caused by training. Motor learning includes the development of a parameterized motor program, which forms the basis of the feedforward control strategy, as well as the gradual reduction of the variability in the newly developed motor program via sensory feedback loops"

## Key Points
#### Overview
> "The aim of research in motor learning is to enhance these examples of complex motor (re-)learning by optimizing instructions and feedback."

> "Technical displays, which have become increasingly common for providing augmented feedback, can also address different modalities: vision (screens, head-mounted displays), hearing (speakers, headphones), haptics (robots, vibrotactile actuators), or a combination of them."

#### Three phases of motor learning
1. "... a first movement representation--that is, the motor program--of the to-be-learned task is formed."
2. "... a second phase, the motor presentations are further refined, and error detection/correction mechanisms are improved."
3. "... a third phase, movements are performed in a highly automatized and consistent manner."

#### What counts as complex tasks
> "We will judge tasks to be complex if they generally cannot be mastered in a single session, have several degrees of freedom, and perhaps tend to be ecologically valid. Tasks will be judged as simple if they have only one degree of freedom, can be mastered in a single practice session, and appear to be artificial."

#### The gap of multimodal feedback for motor learning
> "To our knowledge, concurrent augmented audiohaptic, or even audiovisuohaptic feedback, for motor learning has not been investigated so far."

#### Why (and why not) multimodal learning
> "Many researchers believe that the positive effect of multimodal learning originates from a reduction of the cognitive load due to a distribution of information processing."

> "This theory refers to the multiple-resource theory of Wickens (2002), which states that a distribution of information to different modalities is superior than providing the same amount of information in one modality"

> "All these findings on memory and cognitive load imply that if workload is high in one modality, augmented feedback should be given in another modality or in a multimodal way."

> "For movements with a small number of relevant variables, ... the representation of a single variable by visual and auditory features at the same time can increase task performance."

> "... audiovisual feedback is most effective in single tasks under normal workload conditions. In tasks with a high workload, audiovisual feedback is rather detrimental"

> "Visuotactile displays were reported to be most effective in various tasks with high workload"

#### The difference between modalities
> "The human senses differ in their capabilities. Vision is very precise in the perception of spatial information, whereas hearing is very precise in the perception of temporal information"

> "The perception of haptics can fulfill relatively high demands on processing both temporal and spatial information ... and is believed to be the most direct form of motor information ..., because haptic feedback can mechanically change the movement by applying forces on the body"

#### How to design multimodal feedback
> "... prior to any comparison of multimodal augmented feedback strategies, feedback designs should be optimized and systematically evaluated."

#### Suggestions on using multimodal feedback
> "Particularly in the early, attention-demanding learning phase, concurrent augmented feedback may help the novice to understand the new structure of the movement faster and prevent cognitive overload, which may accelerate the learning process. Concurrent augmented feedback may also be beneficial for experts, since learning of specific details of the movement can be complex, when the expert  has to overcome automated but incorrect movement."

> "Still, selections might not be optimal, because learners' self-estimation of their current performance might be wrong and learners might not have the valuable expertise of a trainer who knows which actions are needed to make progress."

> "Thus, in terms of future feedback strategies, we suggest evaluating feedback designs in each modality on their interpretability, practicability, and motivational character first."
