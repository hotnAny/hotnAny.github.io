## One Sentence
This paper summarizes a type of direct manipulation interfaces: the general ideas, existing exemplar systems, explanations of benefits and trade-offs, and other potential applications.

## More Sentences
#### What is direct manipulation?
> "The central ideas seemed to be visibility of the object of interest; rapid, reversible, incremental actions; and replacement of complex command language syntax by direct manipulatin of the object of interest ..."

<br/>

#### What were some of the successful examples?

* Display editor (as opposed to line editor, such as those operated in a command line)
* Visicalc (an early version of spreadsheet)
* Spatial data management (akin to interacting with entities over a map or some sort of geographical area)
* Video games (Donkey Kong, Pong, BreakOut, etc.) 

<br/>

#### How direct manipulation made a difference in a display editor?

* "Display of a full 24 to 66 lines of text"
* "Display of the document in its final form"
* "Cursor action that is visible to the user"
* "Cursor motion through physically obvious intuitively natural means"
* "Labeled buttons for action"
* "Immediate display of the results of an action"
* "Rapid action and display"
* "Easily reversible commands"

<br/>

#### How have people tried to characterize direct manipulation?
> "What you see is what you get, " is a phrase used by Don Hatfield of IBM and others to describe the general approach

<br/>

> "What you see is what you have got. " (Harold Thimbleby) The display should indicate a complete image of what the current status is, what errors have occurred, and what actions are appropriate, ...

<br/>

#### What are the problems of direct manipulation?

* If the content of the graphic representation is designed inproperly (e.g., cluttering), it will lead to greater confusion
* "... users must learn the meaning of the components of the graphic representation"
* "... graphic representation may be misleading" (XAC: because it's too open-ended, too indefinite?)
* "... graphic representation may take excessive screen display space"

<br/>

#### What are syntactic/semantic knowledge and what do they have to do with direct manipulation?

|  Knowledge		| Level 	|  Application-dependent? 	|  Memory |  Example |
| :---------------: | :-------: | :-----------------------: | :-----: | --------- |
|  Syntactic 		| Low 		|  Yes 						|  Rote memory| In a text editor, ... include permissible item delimiters (space, comma, slash, or colon), insertion of a new line after the third line ... or the keystroke necessary for erasing a character ... |
|  Semantic 		| High 		|  No 						|  Stable in memory |  (In a text editor) "move the cursor to the beginning of the sentece, mark this second position, copy the sentence to a buffer area ..."

## Other Points
> "Driving an automobile is my favorite example of direct manipulation. The scene is directly visible through the windshield, and actions such as braking or steering have become common skills in our culture. To turn to the left, simply rotate the steering wheel to the left. The response is immediate, and the changing scene provides feedback to refine the turn. Imagine trying to turn by issuing a LEFT 30 DEGREES command and then issuing another command to check your position, but this is operational level of many office automation tools today."

<br/>

> "The strong attraction of these games contrasts markedly with the anxiety and resistance many users experience toward office automation equipment."

<br/>

> "As users gain experience, they increasingly think in higher level semantic terms, which are freer from the syntactic detail and more system independent."

<br/>

> "Familiar visual analogies may be more appealing in the early stages of learning the system, while more specific abstract models may be more useful during regular use."

<br/>

> "The trick in creating a direct manipulation system is to come up with an appropriate representation or model of reality"

<br/>

> "... attract users because it is comprehensible, natural, rapid, and even enjoyable. If actions are simple, reversibility ensured, and retention easy, then anxiety recedes and satisfaction flows in."
