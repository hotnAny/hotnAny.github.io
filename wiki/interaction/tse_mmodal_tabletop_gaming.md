## One Sentence

## Key Points
#### Deixis: speech refined by gestures
> "Deictic references are speech terms ('this', 'that', etc.) whose meanings are disambiguated by spatial gestures (e.g., pointing to a location)."

> "Bolt states [1] and Oviatt confirms [13] that such input provides individuals with a briefer, syntactically simpler and more fluent means of input than speech alone."

#### Complementary modes
> "For example, studies show that speech is less useful for describing locations and objects that are preceptually accessible to the user, with other modes such as pointing and gesturing being fare more appropirate [3, 5, 13]. Similarly, speech is more useful than gestures for specifying abstract or discrete actions (e.g., Fly to Boston)."

#### Natural interaction
> "... higbhly visual surfaces such as maps ... The symbiosis between speech and gestures are verified in the strong user preferences stated by people performing map-based tasks: 95% preferred multimodal interaction vs. 5% preferred pen only. No one preferred a speech only interface [13]."

## Take-Away
* Look into the concept of 'alouds'
