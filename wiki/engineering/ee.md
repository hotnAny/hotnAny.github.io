* **Solid-state electronics** concerns itself with the study of electronics that consist entirely of solid materials with electrons or other charge carriers confined entirely within those materials, which contrasts earlier technology based on vaccum or gas-discharge tubes. In other words, with solid-state electronics, current flows through solid matters by means of the movement of electrons. Examples of solid-state electronics include transistors, microprocessor, RAM, solid-state drives, light-emitting diode (LED), liquid-crystal display (LCD), and integrated circuits (IC).
