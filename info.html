TITLE <br/>
Tool Support for End-User Design Customization
</p>

<p>
ABSTRACT <br/>
We are looking towards a future where a wide range of fabrication machines--from desktop 3D printers to industrial robotic arms--will allow end-users to create functional objects of their designs. For end-users, traditional Computer-Aided Design tools are notoriously difficult to use, as they require complex and tedious tasks of manipulating low-level geometry.

In my research, I develop computational design tools that enable end-users to express and iterate high-level ideas into fabrication-ready 3D models. For example, Forte lets users sketch a design and annotate its functional descriptions, which then generaties sturctures that continuously address users's evolving design intent while ensuring structural integrity; Reprise allows users to specify how they want to adapt existing objects for accessibility, and generates add-on structures to mechanically modify the usage of these objects; Medley provides a library of embeddables--everyday objects that be cut, worked and embedded into users' customized design to explore rich reusable material properties. I will describe an achitectural framework underpinning all these tools, where the ultimate goal is three-fold: providing users with domain-specific knowledge, expressive interaction techniques, and computational support.

BIO <br/>
Xiang 'Anthony' Chen recently graduated from his PhD working with Scott Hudson and Stelian Coros in the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. His research develops technical and design approaches to build novel human-computer interfaces that enhance users' physical interactivity with ubiquitous computers, or enable their creativity in fabricating physical objects of their design (e.g., using 3D printing). Anthony is an Adobe Research Fellow in Human-Computer Interaction. Frequently collaborating with industrial research labs (Microsoft, Autodesk, and Google), he has published 13 papers in top-tier HCI conferences and journal (CHI, UIST, and TOCHI) and has received two best paper awards.
