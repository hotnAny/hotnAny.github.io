				<b>ABSTRACT </b>
				<br />
				The recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) promises a future of data-driven automation that can replace most of today's human efforts. However, currently most AI-enabled systems—often functioning as 'black boxes'—struggle to accommodate, learn from or communicate with humans. One fundamental problem is a limited interaction bandwidth between human and AI: currently, AI's development is bestowed upon the few experts; for users in non-computing domains, there is limited support for them to comprehend, control or collaborate with AI. As we are on the cusp of defining the future of human-AI relationship, it is important to create new interaction channels to bridge AI and non-computing users. In this talk, I will discuss three research thrusts for expanding the interaction bandwidth between human and AI:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Human ← AI: making AI comprehensible to humans. For example, CheXplain is a system co-designed via iterative studies with medical professionals, which enables referring physicians to explore and understand;AI-generated diagnosis on chest X-ray images.
					</li>
					<li>
						Human → AI: enabling humans to control AI. Contrary to providing a single label, my research investigates techniques for users to express their domain knowledge in ways that are understandable and learnable to an AI;
					</li>
					<li>
						Human ↔ AI: supporting collaboration between humans and AI. For example, xPath is a tool that provides pathologists with a top-down view to oversee AI's examination of low-level histological data, similar to how they work with human trainees.

					</li>
				</ul>
