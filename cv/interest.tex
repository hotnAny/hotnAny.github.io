% I develop design tools to enable people's physical creativity with fabrication technology.\\
% Before, I explored interaction techniques with an ecosystem of wearable and mobile devices.
%I take a hybrid of design and technical approaches to develop interfaces that enhance users' digital experience and physical creativity with an ecosystem of devices.
%I develop technical and design approaches to build novel human-computer interfaces that enhance users' physical \textbf{interactivity} with computers, or enable their \textbf{creativity} of making physical objects of their design.
% I study, design, and build user interface systems that enable people to interact with an eco-system of devices, from wearables, mobiles, appliances to fabrication machines such as 3D printers.
We believe the ultimate goal of inventing the computer is to augment our human selves. To achieve this, my group's research focuses on the following three topics:
\begin{itemize} 
    \item {\bfseries Intelligent User Interfaces}: how can we design interfaces of intelligent systems that augment a user to accomplish domain-specific tasks?
    \item {\bfseries Sensing \& Interaction Techniques}: how can we invent new sensors and devices that afford novel experiences for users to interact with a computer?
    \item {\bfseries Computational Design \& Fabrication}: how can we build computational platforms that empower users to realize their ideas into digital or physical artifacts?
\end{itemize}
