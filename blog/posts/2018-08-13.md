# Some excellent points from Rachel Thomas

These excerpts are from this [article](http://www.fast.ai/2018/08/07/hbr-bias-algorithms/).

> "- algorithms are often implemented without any appeals method in place (due to the misconception that algorithms are objective, accurate, and won’t make mistakes) 
> "- algorithms are often used at a much larger scale than human decision makers, in many cases, replicating an identical bias at scale (part of the appeal of algorithms >is how cheap they are to use) 
> "- users of algorithms may not understand probabilities or confidence intervals (even if these are provided), and may not feel comfortable overriding the algorithm in practice (even if this is technically an option)"

> "Most people working on medical applications of AI are not trying to replace doctors; they are trying to create tools that will allow doctors to be more accurate and more efficient, improving quality of care."

> "Cathy O’Neil writes in Weapons of Math Destruction that the algorithms she is critiquing tend to punish the poor. They specialize in bulk, and they’re cheap. That’s part of their appeal. The wealthy, by contrast, often benefit from personal input. A white-shoe law firm or an exclusive prep school will lean far more on recommendations and face-to-face interviews than will a fast-food chain or a cash-strapped urban school district. The privileged, we’ll see time and again, are processed more by people, the masses by machines. (emphasis mine)"
