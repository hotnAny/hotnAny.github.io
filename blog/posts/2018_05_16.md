# Another perspective on mixed-initiative interaction

One day I received an email from Google Photos, reminding me that it had taken the liberty of creating some animations and 'instagram' effects from the photos I took in my phone.

I clicked open the Google Photo site. The animations and effects were pretty awesome. In particular, the animation is a series of stop-motion I took of my wife. I sent the animation to her and we laughed at it.

It dawned on me that this is another type of *mixed-initiative interaction*& (or just *action* in this case). Traditionally, being mixed-initiative means the computer recognizes something from some data and proactively takes certain actions on behalf of the user, which, however, is easily undoable if the user doesn't desire so. In the Google Photos example, the computer looks through my pile of photos before I have time to do so, and create new content from those photos for me, which can be shared if I like or ignored/deleted if otherwise.

The general benefit of this mixed-initiative action is the computer does something for me that saves my attention and labor, in a minimally intrusive way.

Think of it another way. It's like a very close friend who considerately send you a little something they create for you from your data.
