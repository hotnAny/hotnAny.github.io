# On giving a good demo

### 1. Preparation and rehearsal
* although don’t expect a marathon run; set pause to answer questions and then go on;
* you can almost never give a demo right the first time; rehearse and improve.
    
### 2. Better stitch it with a coherent story
* the opposite is simply enumerating a laundry list of features.

### 3. Set the scene
* I found if you give sufficient background and build-up of your project, people already get a substantial part of it.

### 4. Promote social interaction
* avoid doing a monologue; try to provoke some thinking and interaction; it’s also beneficial to elicit questions and feedback from people.

### 5. Demo often
* practice makes perfect.
