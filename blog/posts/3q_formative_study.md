# A Minimal Viable Method for Running a Formative Study

One fundamental belief in HCI is that technology should be centered on people's needs. 
Specifically, to design or build technology that supports specific users' tasks or activities, it is important to first understand what they do, how they do it, and what they need from a technology.
While there are a plethora of ways to conduct such a need-finding or formative study, here is a "minimal viable" method that consists of asking three questions:

- **Current approaches**: How do people perform the task now?
- **Pain points**: What are the difficulties they experience?
- **Expectations**: How do they expect a technology to help?

## Current approaches
Here's how we ask some pathologists when developing [a human-AI collaborative tool](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ncRzqGFjiYcwFQdvmPRn_hxYcdM9VK3V/view) to support their examination of medical images.

> ... we started by describing the projectâ€™s motivation and presented participants with a real meningioma WSI [Whole Slide Image]. Next, we asked the participants to examine the case and encouraged them to talk aloud about their examination process.

The goal here is simply asking your users to show and tell how they conduct a task from beginning to end, which, in our project, is examining a histopathological image to determine the grade of a brain tumor.

Further, it is possible to introduce more formal and elaborate protocol, such as asking the user to think aloud as they perform the task or conducting a contextual inquiry to shadow and observe the user in their natural work environment.

## Pain points
In the same aforementioned project, we continued to ask what pathologists struggled with.

> We followed up with a semi-structured interview and let the participants describe the challenges in their practice and their expectations of an AI-enabled system to assist such a process.

When possible, you should contextualize and ground the discussion of pain points in the user's narrative of how they currently perform the task.

It is also possible to employ the [Critical Incident Technique](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/critical-incident-technique/) where you already have some knowledge about what kinds of pain points there might be and prompt the user to provide more specific details by recalling a critical incident in the past.

## Expectations
One example comes from another of our projects about designing [an explainable AI radiologist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1op5naceGh4rZRYL5UHC2eFWCrtD_IZD9/view), except we asked these questions in a survey rather than an interview.

> Further, we asked another set of questions only to referring physicians, specifically about when and what kinds of explanations they expect if the results were to come from an AI rather than a human radiologist.

Here we try to ask the user how they'd want a technology to help them with the task or, in general, how that technology ought to be in order for them to use it.

Often the user's expectation is not only about new features or functionalities; they could also expect the technology to follow certain norms, such as AI not generating fabricated information or a device with a reliable network connection.

## Final Thoughts
<!-- why this flow makes sense -->
The ultimate goal of a formative study is to elicit requirements of a technology from users.
This simple three-question protocol achieves this goal by first setting the scene with a user narrative of their current approaches, building on which the identification of pain points, which further leads to expectations of technology.
<!-- why using such a minimal viable version -->
This is a minimal viable method that would require relatively little resource, that can be expanded to include other methods, or that can serve as the first of multiple user-centered design iterations.
