richard hamming used to spend fridays only on great thoughts rather than continuing with the day-to-day work.

> When I went to lunch Friday noon, I would only discuss great thoughts after that. By great thoughts I mean ones like: "What will be the role of computers in all of AT&T?", "How will computers change science?''
