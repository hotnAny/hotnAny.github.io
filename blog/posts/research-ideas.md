# Coming Up with Research Ideas

This is a common question researchers---across all levels of experiences---encounter all the time. 
Although successful researchers seem to possess some secret sauce of their own, I believe coming up with ideas is more than a single act (i.e., the eureka moment); 
rather, it is part of a larger system that encompass multiple methods.

## Train yourself to be a creative person
Foremost, for HCI research at least, creativity is a prerequisite of ideation.
Creativity, like many other cognitive and physical abilities, require practice.
Some might consider a person's creativity as limited resource, like a bucket of water that will run out.
I read a contrary point somewhere that says the more you use your creative brain, the more creativity there will be.
So the first and most fundamental thing to do is training yourself to be a creative person, not just in research, not just in a specific domain, but in any areas that interest you.
It could be arts and crafts, writing a novel, building a tree house, or cooking a meal.

## Use techniques to convert creativity to ideas
The following techniques are useful when you actually sit down and think of what research ideas you should work on.

### Sketch
One of my HCI colleagues once said something like "I can't think without using my pen".
Indeed, sketching, like how it serves as a low-fidelity prototyping technique, helps ideation because it creates a space for you to see and explore ideas in tangible, visual forms.
Instead of staring at the blank, take a piece of paper and start writing or drawing about ideas. Use multiple pieces of papers. Use larger pieces of papers. Sketch on a whiteboard if it's available.

### Keep an ideation log
One challenge of sketching (physically) is the difficulty to quickly change or search for things.
So a complementary technique is using a Google Doc or a simple text file to log ideas.
I find such a doc useful for two reasons.
First, multi-threading. If your thoughts tend to jump across numerous unconnected idea, you can create different bins in the ideation log to buffer those thoughts and organize them later.
Second, iterative outlining. Say you have already come up with a promising idea and need to further think of a more detailed research plan. You can gradually grow an outline using the ideation log by non-linearly adding new ideas here and there.
Both could be done on physical papers but less elegantly and much effort- and time-consuming.

Note that you can't expect to do either sketching or an ideation log in one sitting and take away with a great idea.
It often takes days or even weeks to repetitively conduct these two exercises, which brings us to the previous point about training yourself as a creative person.
Rather than doing sketching or ideation log on demand, try doing them regularly regardless of whether you are in need of a research idea.
They are effective exercises to build up your creative brain muscles.
For example, some researchers grow a list or deck of ideas over time and refer to them before defining a project.

## Develop ideas after coming up with them
There is also a lengthy and often painful phase once you think you have come up with a promising research ideas. 
You will need to "poke" the idea in all sorts of ways to verify or further develop it.
Here are some approaches.

### Ask for feedback
The simplest way is discussing your idea over with a colleague or collaborator. 
It so often happens that the moment I start pitching my idea to another person I realize something is off.
Pay attention to the "yes, but" response of your audience. This is where they sense something is not quite right even though they might not be able to articulate it or offer a solution.

### Write an introduction
Write the introduction of a paper as if you have already finished working on the idea.
My introduction often amounts to answering [five questions](/blog/#5p-intro).
In essence, this process has similar effects as communicating your idea to some audience.
You will most definitely notice something you haven't considered and can develop the idea further by freshing out those details.

### Read related literature
Search for papers that have done work similar to your idea and you are likely to find something related is already out there.
Read the literature, compare it with your idea, and further develop the idea for better differentiation.
This activity should happen iteratively as your idea evolves.
In general, reading can be another long-term activity that informs and cultivates your creativity.

## Develop a long-term vision
Finally, coming up with research ideas shouldn't feel like a scavenger hunt. 
If you have a long-term vision about where your research is heading into a far future, you can use that vision as a spotlight to help you find ideas.
