# A Template for Writing Paper Reading Summary

It's important to properly document the papers you read so that later you can revisit the notes and effectively recall what the paper is about. 
Here is a five-part template that I recommend:

* **One Sentence**: Summarize the entire paper in one sentence;
* **More Sentences**: Optional, additional sentences to help contextualize what the paper is about;
* **Key Points**: Important and useful nuggets of information learned from the paper;
* **Other Notes**: Good-to-know information that is not the core of the paper;
* **Take-Away**: Thoughts inspired by the paper, such as criticism, new ideas, and actionable items.

## One Sentence
The most useful thing about this sentence is that it helps you quickly recall what the paper is about, in your own words.
When citing a paper in my writing, I often start by copying and pasting this sentence.
Then I read the rest of the paper summary and extend that sentence based on my writing purposes.

## More Sentences
However, when one sentence is not enough to cover the gist of a paper, you can write more in this part.
Sometimes I will also quote the paper's own summary here for reference, such as the description of key findings in its abstract.

## Key Points
This is where I record the marginalia. 
I usually print out a paper and physically write notes as I read it. 
A note often consists of some highlighted text in the paper and my own comments.
After I finish reading the paper, I will sort the marginalia, transcribing the important ones in this part.
The key points here should be important enough that you would want to mention them if you cite this paper.

## Other Notes
For the less important ones (but still good to know), they will go into this part.

## Take-Away
Finally, I write down my thoughts engendered from reading the paper.
These could be criticism of the paper's methods and findings, new ideas you come up with, or some actionable ways to use what you read in this paper in your own work.
It's really useful to give yourself time and space to explore this part.
Often times I would read a paper related to an ongoing project and come up with some unique ideas, only to forget about them later when working on that project.
If you document those ideas here, you will have a chance ot revisit them later when you cite this paper.
