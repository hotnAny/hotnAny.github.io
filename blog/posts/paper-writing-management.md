# Paper Writing Mangement

<!-- tldr -->


<!-- what is paper writing management -->
just like time management
a big part of how the paper is written is dependent on how the research is done; but there is also a big part that can go well (if managed well) regardless of what research is being done or how.

mostly apply to system research papers that often consist of design, implementation and evaluation other than the usual sections

<!--  -->

overall goal is to iterate as many times as possible before submission

start writing the intro early
why: comm medium; roadmap; thinking and reflection; so that can iterate more

should i write the abstract early too? could. but i find abstract is too short/limited/constrained for me to "think thru writing".

depends on your experience. junior researchers might feel they can't write the intro at all unless they have finished all the work. but still try to push yourself to write it early.

then related work, most effort-consuming cuz need to read those papers first!
doesn't mean rw has to follow right after intro in the paper

do at least two passes of outlining for the rest of the paper, one high level (section/subsection), which should be easy;
another going into more details (subsubsection -> a brief sentence for each paragraph)


<!--  -->
write everything except results in the study/experiment sections
you might have conceived your study design and protocol very clearly in your head or in an informal doc. but once you start writing it seriously as if convey it to reviewers, you will start realizing certain things you miss. i often end up making important revisions to my study plan after i write it down

<!--  -->
the non-linear part: discussion. could be another post. should write down ideas and thoughts to discuss whenever they come up; hard to write it all at once near the end.


<!--  -->
make a writing schedule

W1: intro v1; paper reading for rw
W2: paper reading for rw
W3: paper reading for rw
W4: intro v2; paper reading for rw
W5: outline v1; paper reading for rw
W6: rw
W7: rw; outline v2
W8: study/eval/exp all-but-results v1
W9: intro v3
W10: study/eval/exp all-but-results v2
W11: design & implementation
W12: design & implementation
W13: study results
W14: first draft
...

note that iterations of the same section are spaced out so allow for fresh thoughts.
