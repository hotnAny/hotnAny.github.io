# Deep Work Journal #1

Time frame: roughly 7/7-7/14/2022

## What went well

* I never intentionally corrected my jet lag and am able to keep getting up at around 0700 each day;
* My morning consists of two (intended) deep work sessions: 07030-0930 and 0945-1145;
* During these two sessions I could more or less focus, although I haven't felt I was particularly productive;
* The 2nd deep work session has been worse, maybe due to fatigue and hunger (I am fasting, too);
* For a few nights I was able to stay off my phone during my sleep period (sometimes for the whole evening);

## What needed more work

* Afternoons were for shallow work---so far the time feels a little too disorganized/fragmented;
* Outside of the deep work hours, my time remains quite fragmented (at least I could feel the urge of shallowness).
I am concerned about this because it might suggest my brain is not being 'rewired' by the deep work; it just stays shallow.
If I could resist shallowness more outside of the deep work hours maybe I could have an easier time doing deep work (with a higher quality)?
* In a few waiting-in-line situations (the most memorable one being waiting for 30 minutes at Domino), I just gave up and stayed on my phone the whole time;

## Lessons learned
* Putting the phone physically away is the most effective way of reducing usage;
* There should be a better way to use Twitter without hopping short tweets (that fragments attention);
