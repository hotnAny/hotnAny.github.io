# An Algorithm of Performing Literature Search

Here's the algorithm I develop for doing organized literature search (so that you don't get lost in the ocean of papers).

## The algorithm

```
come up with sets of keywords to describe your subject;
FOR EACH set of keywords:
	perform Google Scholar search;
	FOR EACH of the search results (papers) on page #1 to #N: // e.g., N=3
		IF the paper seems related:
			document the paper;
			expand the 'cited by';
			FOR EACH of the cited-by paper on page #1 to #M: // e.g., M=1
				IF the paper seems related:
					document the paper
				ENDIF
			ENDFOR
		ENDIF
	ENDFOR
ENDFOR
```

The overall spirit is to follow a *shallow depth-first search*. You don't want to delve into a particular paper at this point; rather you'd like to find as many significantly related papers as possible. This helps you obtain a holistic understanding of your topic and avoid omitting research that might have already scooped your idea. Of course, you can and must read some papers in details, but that should happen later after this search.

## Walk-through

To better undrestand how it works, let's walk through the process using a specific example. Let's say you'd like to do some literature search on interacting with smart watches using a camera as a sensor. 

**Step 1: Develop several sets of keywords related to your subject**. Try to develop different ways of describing this subject. For example, ```{camera, smart, watch, interaction}``` could be your first try. How about ```{camera, wrist, interaction}``` where the device might not necessarily be a watch? How about ```{computer vision, watch, interaction}```?

**Step 2: Perform first-level search**. Hit Google Scholar with a set of keywords, and start scanning down the page.

If you see a paper that seems related (e.g., this Orbits paper), open the link in a new tab and read the abstract. If the paper is indeed related, perform a quick documentation, e.g., in a separate document, copy and paste the title and the most indicative sentence of the abstract (if you can't find one just copy and paste the entire abstract).

**Step 3: Perform second-level search**. Now close the tab and you are back in the first-level search results. The next step is to see which other papers cited this one, because those cited-by papers might be very similar to you (at least both of you think of the same paepr as related).

Open the cited-by link in a new tab and scan to see if there is any paper that seems related. If there is, document it.

**Step 4: Go back and repeat**
Now a question arises: do you keep going deeper and deeper or go back to the first level? I usually choose to go back, unless a cited-by paper seems extremely related and/or popular (highly cited). There are two reasons not to go deeper: 1) it becomes easily confusing where you are as you go deeper and deeper; 2) the relevance to your original subject inevitably weakens as you go deeper as the papers now have more and more degree of separation. 

So you don't go deep but keep scanning for the next related cited-by paper. How many more pages do you need to scan? For cited-by papers, I usually do one page, unless the first page is so full of related papers that I am convinced that there are more in the pages that follow. 

Once you are done with that one page of cited-by papers, you go back to first-level search and repeat Step 2. How many more pages do you need to scan before switching to the next set of keywords? I usually do three pages, which again also depends on how many related papers your keywords draw. I wouldn't just do one page or go over five.

## What's next?

Now you are done with all the keywords, first-level and second-level searches, what's next? 

* Do it again some other time. Maybe you would come up with different keywords, find new papers, or recognize the relevance of some papers you had missed earlier.
* Read the papers you have found. Pick the ones that stand out as most related.
* Each paper you choose to read cited more papers. Scan those papers and document the related ones.
