# What I Learned from a Summer Living in Japan


## Clean & Neat

Japan is well-known for being an extremely clean country, especially in public places such as sidewalks, subway, and restrooms. There is an excellent [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20191006-what-japan-can-teach-us-about-cleanliness) that analyzes how the Japanese manage to maintain such cleaniness. Two of main driving forces: 1) Buddhism and Shinto that emphasize the practice of cleaning physical places as a means of cleaning one's mental places; and 2) The habit of cleaniness is educated and passed along generations, thus becoming almost inborn.

I think the secrete to cleaniness is keeping it that way. It is hard to make a dirty place become clean but it is easier to keep a clean place stay clean. As a corollary, a public place can never be clean if some of its users would occasionally make a mess and there is no regular cleaning schedules.

In addition to cleaniness, I also found Japan to be very neat. For example, in both London and Tokyo, I saw garbage bags piled up on the street waiting to be picked up. But, in Tokyo, I often saw an additional blue net covering the garbage so that, according to [this article](https://www.thejapanguy.com/how-to-recycle-in-japan/), the bags are more stable and organized.

What does it mean to be neat? I think it means being considerate and thoughtful even on small details. As another example, to help recycling plastic bottles, people in Japan will even remove the cap and plastic wrap of a bottle; further, the plastic wrap has this design that makes it easier to rip it off the bottle.
