# What I Learned from a Summer Living in Japan


## Clean & Neat

Japan is well-known for being an extremely clean country, especially in public places such as sidewalks, subway, and restrooms. There is an excellent [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20191006-what-japan-can-teach-us-about-cleanliness) that analyzes how the Japanese manage to maintain such cleanness. Two of main driving forces: 1) Buddhism and Shinto that emphasize the practice of cleaning physical places as a means of cleaning one's mental places; and 2) The habit of cleanness is educated and passed along generations, thus becoming almost inborn. 

One example of such habitual cleanness is not producing trash on the street. Unlike many modern cities, I always couldn't find trash cans on the streets in Japan. People usually just don’t produce trash (by, for instance, not eating or drinking when walking on the streets). When they do have trash, I heard from my colleague that Japanese would just carry it home.

I think the secrete to cleanness is keeping it that way. It is hard to make a dirty place become clean but it is easier to keep a clean place stay clean. As a corollary, a public place can never be clean if some of its users would occasionally make a mess and there is no regular cleaning schedules.

In addition to cleanness, I also found Japan to be very neat. For example, in both London and Tokyo, I saw garbage bags piled up on the street waiting to be picked up. But, in Tokyo, I often saw an additional blue net covering the garbage so that, according to [this article](https://www.thejapanguy.com/how-to-recycle-in-japan/), the bags are more stable and organized.

What does it mean to be neat? I think it means being considerate and thoughtful even on small details. As another example, to help recycling plastic bottles, people in Japan will even remove the cap and plastic wrap of a bottle; further, the plastic wrap has this design that makes it easier to rip it off the bottle.

## Safe

Despite the recent shocking incidence of Shinzo Abe's assassination, Japan, in general, is really safe.

The most memorable example in this trip was in Nikko---a small town north of Tokyo decorated with famous temples. After I checked out from the inn, the owner offered to take care of my backpack while I toured around. I thanked him and asked where I should leave it. I was expecting a tag and a locked room. However, the owner told me to just leave it in the lobby. Really? "It's safe", he assured me, "I work here." And then he returned to his desk at the window with his back facing me and my backpack. Well, I just had to trust him I guess. When I returned, the backpack was at the same place waiting for me.

Since then, I developed a sound trust in Japan's safety. For example, I kept leaving my stuff in coffee shops when I went to the restroom. My German colleague Chris told me if you leave, say, your pair of sunglasses in public, you return a few days later and would find them exactly at the same place.

How can a country be so safe? It reminds me of my experience in Croatia. A taxi driver told me it's safe to walk outside in Zagreb at night even in places with few people. "You won't get robbed?" I asked. "If someone tries to rob you and a Croatian sees it, he will help you fight the robber." Apparently that's how Croatians were brought up when seeing a robbery.

I think there are some parallels here. In order for a country to be safe, every one needs to have some shared principles. I wont' steal your stuff left in public so you won't steal mine. I'd help you fight a robber so you'd help me too. I believe such shared principles, however, are not possible if there is a huge social-economic gap.


## Professionalism 

I appreciate how Japanese people exhibit professionalism in their work. Like many others, I frequently visit convenience stores. Once I bought a heated can of coffee, which was not that hot; just lukewarm. However, after paying for it, the lady at the counter stopped me and wrapped a napkin around my coffee. So thoughtful!

Another thing I often encountered was public work on the street. I couldn't help but noticing how work zones in Japan were always properly fenced with signs and every worker was wearing uniforms. I particularly noticed that there was always one worker whose job was to direct the pedestrians walking past the area. They never blocked the sidewalk; they would create a temporary one on the motor lane if needed. You would never see a sign telling you to turn around, cross the street, and pass on the other side. In contrst, in the US, I am often blocked by public work when walking on the street. The US workers once yelled at me when I tried to walk past the work zone. In Japan, I was once pushing a luggage past a work zone and a worker helped me carry it over.


## Quality of Life

Tourists are often impressed by how Japanese food is delicious. This time, I realized that Japanese food is not simply a result of good culinary skills; it is rooted in a high quality of life in Japan. What's the difference? If you go to the most expensive restaurant in any given country, you can very likely enjoy delicious food. In Japan, food is almost never not delicious, even it is a 1000-yen set lunch in a 食事处 hidden in a small alley. I believe what a tourist considers delicious Japanese food is often taken for granted by Japanese people because there is no other way to do food. Japan is simply used to this kind of quality.

And it's not just the food itself. I noticed a number of small things. For example, if you buy a yogurt in Japan and open it, you will notice that the inside of the cover doesn't skim away any of the yogurt underneath. Taking the effort to invent such technology, to me, is an indicator of a high quality of life.


## Tradition

Japan is really a mix pot of its tradition culture and numerous 'imported' elements from the west. Amongst the traditional Japanese cuisines, there are also Western-style restaurants like French or Italian. While stores are populated by various kinds of traditional tea drinks, coffee shops in Japan also felt to me as fanciers than those in the US, approximating the standard in Europe. Hidden in the concrete jungles, you can always find a few temples, most which maintain the traditional appearances. Such coexistence often contrastively reminds me of what happens in China. Unlike Japan, I think China's approach seems more fluid. China has been less stubborn in keeping traditions and less apt at adopting foreign cultures. Growing up, I had the feeling that traditional Chinese new year was becoming less traditional year after year and Christmas more and more like the west (but still not quite).
