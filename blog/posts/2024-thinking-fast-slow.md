This is a book that deserves reading more than once.
So I decided to listen to it first because it might help me read it in a paper version later.

I heard from somewhere else (probably a podcast) that this book was Daniel Kahneman trying to rethink his life's work in a new lens of System I and II. 
Kahneman and his lifelong collaborator Tversky were famous for exposing and expounding a series of human psychological biases and fallacies, such as how people do not perceive gain and loss with equal objectivity.
In this book, Kahneman's main argument seems to be that we suffer from such biases and fallacies because we rely on System I thinking---an fast, gut-feeling-based way of reasoning based on information one has immediate access to. 
Kahneman aptly nicknamed this kind of thinking "what I see is all there is".

From time to time, I tried to think beyond the dense examples in the book to explore some alternative interpretation.

First, human decisions are so subjective and manipulable. Some of Kahneman's experiments almost reached a point of quantitative manipulation, as in experiments that prompt participants to choose between options of ``if you have a X% chance of winning/losing Y amount of money".
This realization should impact both the decision-makers (e.g., customers choosing which products to buy) and decision-architects (e.g., sellers offering different product options). The part that amazes me the most in this realization is that people do have the cognitive capacity to reason logically (it's just simple math!) but our mind somehow managers to lead us astray, like a computer program infested by some virus.

Second, is System I thinking all bad? This book is not saying so, as it mentioned early an example of firefighters employing System I thinking to save lives in split seconds. I believe System I thinking is far more essential than we realize. For example, imaging carrying out a conversation without using System I thinking. You would have to carefully think about and analyze each sentence the other person says, much like someone being interrogated in court. Nobody would enjoy having such a conversation. So it is obvious that we cannot abandon System I thinking but rather should replace them with System II thinking in certain decision-making scenarios. But how about the opposite case? Is there any situation where we should get rid of System II thinking and instead benefit from System I thinking? I don't think this question has been thoroughly answered yet.
