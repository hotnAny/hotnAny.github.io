# Take-away from sitting in a hiring meeting

I had a chance to sit in a hiring decision-making meeting. Here's what I learnt:

- Nobody will bother opening your cv/statement and recap how awesome you are on the paper
- The job talk and the interviews are the only two sources of evidence
- Nobody will linger on details like an issue of your system or a unclarity of a slide—all people remember is the high-level feeling of you and your talk
- Matching the hiring goal outweighs a ton the rest of the factors (i.e., you’ve got to be or do what the company/school wants)
