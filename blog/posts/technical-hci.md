## Why you want to read about technical HCI
Foremost, it is valuable to take a step back from conducting specific research projects and take a good look at your entire research program at arm's length, asking yourself, "What is that I am researching on?"

Pragmatically, such a reflection helps you define and differentiate yourself amongst the large varieties of research in HCI, which is critical when competing for job offers, awards, and grants.


## Discovery vs. Invention
This dichotomy is perhaps *the* minimalistic way to tease out the vastness of HCI.

First, there is discovery research---
> ... parts of HCI that aim to describe or understand the world through, for example, new discoveries about how the world works, critical theory, or models of human behavior

Then, there is inventive research---
> ... the fundamental activity of technical HCI is one of invention—we seek to use technology to expand what can be done or to find how best to do things that can already be done.

A narrower view to contrast this two approaches would be discovery research focuses on studying how technology works while inventive research on creating new technology.

Of course, this dichotomy doesn't mean to classify any given HCI research into binary buckets; rather, one should think of discovery vs. invention as two directions on a spectrum.
Quite a lot of HCI research, for example, is mainly about inventing new interaction techniques while also benefiting from a discovery of users' needs or their feedback after experiencing the techniques.


In any domain, invention is always about creating innovative things. 
To conduct inventive, technical HCI research, there are two general challenges.
<!-- how to come up with an innovative idea -->
<!-- how to realize an innovative idea -->

## Challenge \#1
<!-- Why implementation solutions for invention are not often the most advanced -->

## Methods of invention: science or myth?
<!-- the controversial aspect -->
process not important
cookbook-y
