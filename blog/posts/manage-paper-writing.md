this does not equate the success of a project or the acceptance of the paper

start writing an introduction early 
but not too early
most people don't have an early problem; they tend to write it too late
revisit multiple times


write a minimalistic outline
- should be a very quick task as most of your papers should share a similar overall outline--simply copy and paste the same structure

write a detailed outline
- as detailed as describing each paragraph that will eventually go into the paper

write the experiment or study sections
- all but results

write related work
- most time-consuming part, as it requires reading literature

write the discussion section throughout
- don't want to cramp it last minute. it'd look rushed and shallow. it's easy for a reader to see whether you are thoughtfully discussing or just try to fill up a required section.

when should i finish the first draft?
- depends
- my personal approach is at least two weeks before ddl
- some others like to push it towards the last minute and sometimes it works out for them
- a paper finished ddl-T with T amount of editing time. what is the optimal value of T for you. need to try out different values if you are unsure. it also depends on specific projects as well as how busy you are with other things around that time

write as much as possible when you write best
my approach is to write a little bit every day, distributing the load over a time period as long as possible
the same amount time close to the ddl is different than time further from it: for some people, they write better with the ddl pressure and for others it's the opposite. be aware of which kind of writer you are.

can you spend too much time writing the paper?
the answer is yes if, instead of writing, you should spend more time doing the actual work. in other words, you could spend too much time writing about work that isn't ready to be written, hoping the writing can make up for the work's lack of contribution or rigor. this seldom works.
