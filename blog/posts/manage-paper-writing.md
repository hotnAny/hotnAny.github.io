# Paper Writing Management

When I was doing my PhD, I had a squash partner who was a Physics PhD student. I don’t remember many of our conversations between games, but one in particular stuck with me. We were talking about writing papers, and he said that for him, once he figured out the math, writing the paper was just about filling in the space between equations.

My reaction then (and still now): that’s definitely not the case in HCI—or in many computing subfields, for that matter.

Writing an academic paper is about documenting and presenting a research project, but the writing process itself is complex and fragmented. In fact, it often feels like a project of its own—and like any good project, it needs proper management.

Here’s my personal process, in roughly chronological order:

## Writing the Introduction

I usually start writing the introduction earlier rather than later (though I know some people don’t touch it until a week before the deadline). The ideal time is when you have lots of ideas and a good sense of the project, but things still feel messy and unstructured. Writing the introduction can help clarify your thinking, reveal gaps or inconsistencies, and provide a clearer direction.

But don’t start *too* early. If you haven't gathered enough experience or results, you might get stuck or too attached to a particular framing, making it harder to adapt as the project evolves.

I revisit, revise, and sometimes even rewrite the introduction multiple times throughout the project. Spacing out these iterations—say, every few weeks—helps me reflect on how I’m framing the work and adjust the actual research to better align with the high-level narrative.

## Writing the Overall Outline

The first outline should be quick. Most of your papers will follow a similar structure, so just copy and tweak a previous one.

Next, try to flesh out subsection (or even sub-subsection) titles. For example, what specific topics will your related work section cover?

Before you write the full text, do one more pass and outline each paragraph with bullet points. This step helps you think at a finer granularity and makes the actual writing much easier.

## Writing the Experiment (Everything But the Results)

I focus on the experiment section early for two reasons. First, the success of the paper often hinges on the quality and execution of the experiment. Second, writing it helps you design, plan, and reflect on your study.

As with the outline, start with a reusable template: participants, tasks, procedure, design, etc. Then, fill in the details. Think of it like explaining your plan to a reviewer. Often, you’ll notice something doesn’t quite make sense—better to catch it during writing than mid-study.

## Writing the Related Work

I usually tackle the related work section next, because it’s time-consuming and requires a lot of reading. The upside is that it's highly modular—you can write it one paper you review at a time and slowly shape it into a coherent whole.

## Writing the Discussion (Throughout)

The Discussion section is tricky. It’s not as central as other sections, but it still matters—and it’s easy to mess up.

A common mistake is leaving it until the last minute. Then you’re scrambling to say something insightful, and it ends up sounding shallow. Readers can tell when you’re just filling space.

Instead, I write the Discussion gradually. Whenever an idea comes to mind—something worth reflecting on—jot it down under the Discussion section. By the end, you’ll have a rich set of points to expand into a thoughtful discussion.

## Finishing the First Draft

The “first draft” should be as complete as possible—ideally good enough to submit, though not quite good enough to accept.

Set a firm early deadline for the first draft. This helps you avoid both procrastination and perfectionism, and ensures you and your co-authors have enough time to iterate.

How early? That depends on your work style, the project’s progress, and how long the paper will take to write. A good rule of thumb is to aim for 1–2 weeks before the actual deadline.

## Develop a Moderate Daily Writing Routine

To follow this plan, I find it helpful to maintain a moderate, daily writing habit. Since my PhD days, I’ve written for about 45 minutes each morning with my coffee.

This “little bit every day” approach helps spread out the work, reduce stress, and create more space for reflection and deeper thinking. However, this only works if you start early enough.

## FAQs

**What if you’re deadline-driven and only write well under pressure?**  
Then maybe these tips aren’t for you (though you might still give them a try). The key is to write when you write best. For you, maybe one hour under deadline pressure might be worth more than three hours weeks earlier. Just know what kind of writer you are.

**Does managing the writing process increase your chance of paper acceptance?**  
Not really. Good management won’t save a weak contribution. But it *will* reduce your stress and free up energy for tackling the hard parts of the research.

**Can you spend too much time writing?**  
Absolutely. Sometimes, instead of writing, you should be doing more research. Writing can't compensate for a lack of contribution or rigor. If the work isn’t ready, trying to write it into shape usually doesn’t work.
