# Paper Writing Management

When I was studying my PhD I had a squash partner who was a PhD student in Physics. I don't remember many of our conversations in between the squash ames but one distinctively stood out. Once we talked about writing papers and he told me for him, once he figured out the math, writing the paper is just filling in the space between equations. My reaction back then (and right now): it's not so the case in HCI, or many computing subfields in general.

The purpose of writing an academic paper is to document and present a research project, yet such a process itself contains so many bits and pieces that it almost feels like a project of its own and a successful project needs good management.

Below is my own recipe in chronological order.

## Writing the introduction
I often start writing the introduction early rather than late (I know some people would start writing the introduction a week before the paper deadline).
The optimal timing is when you feel you have a lot of ideas and know what you need to do but not in a well-organized manner. Then, writing an introduction can help you sort out your thoughts, see what might be off or missing, and lay out your project in a more structured way.
But don't writing the introduction too early, as you are likely to get stuck because you haven't accumulated sufficient experiences in the project or get tunnel-visioned into the written version of the project, making it difficult for you to expand or pivot later.
I also revisit, revise, and sometimes rewrite the introduction multiple times throughout the project lifecycle, usually with a few weeks in between each writing iterations. This helps me reflect on how I frame my paper and redirect my actual work to align with the high-level goal.

## Writing the overall outline
write a minimalistic outline
- should be a very quick task as most of your papers should share a similar overall outline--simply copy and paste the same structure

write a detailed outline
- as detailed as describing each paragraph that will eventually go into the paper

## Writing the experiment or study (all but results)
write the experiment or study sections
- all but results

## Writing the related work
write related work
- most time-consuming part, as it requires reading literature

## Writing the discussion (throughout)
write the discussion section throughout
- don't want to cramp it last minute. it'd look rushed and shallow. it's easy for a reader to see whether you are thoughtfully discussing or just try to fill up a required section.

## Finishing the first draft
the milestone for first draft is important
when should i finish the first draft?
- depends
- my personal approach is at least two weeks before ddl
- some others like to push it towards the last minute and sometimes it works out for them
- a paper finished ddl-T with T amount of editing time. what is the optimal value of T for you. need to try out different values if you are unsure. it also depends on specific projects as well as how busy you are with other things around that time

## Making it a moderate daily routine
write as much as possible when you write best
my approach is to write a little bit every day, distributing the load over a time period as long as possible
the same amount time close to the ddl is different than time further from it: for some people, they write better with the ddl pressure and for others it's the opposite. be aware of which kind of writer you are.

can you spend too much time writing the paper?
the answer is yes if, instead of writing, you should spend more time doing the actual work. in other words, you could spend too much time writing about work that isn't ready to be written, hoping the writing can make up for the work's lack of contribution or rigor. this seldom works.

this does not equate the success of a project or the acceptance of the paper
