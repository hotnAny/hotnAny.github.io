# Project-based Diary Study

In a project-based diary study, a participant uses a system to work on a "take-home" project—typically lasting about a week—while keeping a diary to log their experiences and feedback.

## Why this Study?
A typical hour-long lab study is often insufficient to answer certain research questions, as participants might need more time to learn and engage with the system meaningfully.

Even if a participant can quickly grasp how to use the system, lab studies impose time constraints that limit their experiences. While this may be suitable for systems designed for short, discrete tasks, it is inadequate when the expected usage involves longer engagement or deeper exploration before collecting meaningful data.

A key reason for conducting a week- or month-long study is to allow participants to develop their understanding through recurring use, iteratively building their experiences and refining their thoughts. This process results in richer, more nuanced insights about the system.

## Before the Study
The most important preparation step is defining the project. Unlike a task, which is typically short and suitable for a lab study, a project should have a broader scope, requiring more time and sustained effort from participants.

Another consideration is whether all participants should work on the same project or different ones. Using a single project allows for direct comparison of participants' data. However, if your participants come from distinct groups (e.g., different roles within a company), you may need to create variations of the project tailored to each group. The more commonalities between projects, the easier it will be to aggregate and analyze the data later.

## Onboarding the Study
The most critical aspect of onboarding is ensuring that participants clearly understand the project. Otherwise, they might misinterpret the study's goals, take an unexpected approach, or work on something irrelevant—wasting valuable time and resources.

It's also important to define expected usage parameters, such as how many days per week, how many hours per day, and the total expected duration. It is important to emphasize that participants should spread their usage across multiple days, rather than concentrating it all in one session. Repeated engagement with the system allows them to build on previous interactions and deepen their understanding.

In some cases, you can kick off the "take-home" study with a brief lab session to introduce the system and let participants learn and practice to use it.

## During the Study
One useful strategy is to consolidate all onboarding materials and the diary template (for participants to log their experiences) into a single workbook, such as a slide deck. Keeping everything in one place makes it easier for participants to reference key information and for researchers to monitor their progress. A canvas-based medium is often more effective than a simple text document, as participants may want to include images and videos alongside their written feedback.

A mid-study check-in is valuable for catching unexpected issues early and making necessary adjustments. For longer studies spanning several weeks or months, consider implementing regular check-ins, such as weekly surveys or brief catch-up meetings.

Another helpful method is instrumenting logging mechanisms to track participant usage—when, how often, and for how long they interact with the system. This data can help identify participants who engage significantly less than required, allowing for more accurate analysis.

## Wrapping up the Study
An exit interview is essential for concluding the study. Instead of introducing entirely new questions, base the discussion on the participant's diary entries. This approach allows you to ask clarifying and follow-up questions, diving deeper into their recorded experiences and insights.

## Final Thoughts
A project-based diary study immerses participants in repeated interactions with a system over days, weeks, or even months. This extended engagement allows them to document their evolving experiences, thoughts, and feedback—resulting in data that is significantly richer than what a short lab study can provide.
