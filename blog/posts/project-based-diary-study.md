In a project-based diary study of a system, a participant uses the system to work on a project that typically lasts about a week while keeping a diary to log their experiences and feedback.

why?
a typical hour-long lab study is not enough either because it'd take a participant more time to learn.
even if the participant can quickly learn to use a system, in most lab studies, they can only have limited experiences due to time constraints, which might be suitable for systems that support small-chunk, short tasks. however, if the expected usage of a system is much longer or if you'd like them to take their time to do more deep dives before collecting data from them, a lab study isn't enough

## Before the Study
The most important preparation is figuring out the project. Here we use the term project to stress its difference from a task: a project should have a larger scope that should take a participant more time than a task that can be completed in a short lab study.

Another question is should all participants conduct the same or different projects. The argument for same project is so that you can compare different participants' data. However, if your participants consist of distinct groups (e.g., different roles in a company), you might need to define variations of the same project for different groups. Still, the more their projects have in common, the easier it is to aggregate their data later.

## To Kick-off the Study
important to define expected usage, e.g., how many days per week, how many hours per day, and how many horus in total.

## During the Study
typical structure
start with an onboarding session
during the study define how check in


## Wrapping up the Study
exit interview (based on diary entries)

integration (e.g., using slides)

risks
- particiipants might not spend enough time -> find ways to monitor their progress (e.g., check the shared deck) and check in with reminders
-
