openai vs. gemini/google prompted me to think that 1) any novel technology will eventually gets saturated---i.e., many players have all achieved a plateau (sota); 2) then it is the one with a big and stronger ecosystem wins because there'd be more financial backing, more computing resources, more economically convenient to bundle with other services, more reliable and stable in the long run.

related example: iphone (apple) vs. android (samsung). smartphone technology was novel but gradually became saturated. there is no significant diff between an iphone and android in terms of such tech (e.g., camera, touch screen). but the iphone design as well as the apple ecosystem (e.g., seamless connection with and transition to/fro other apple devices)

counter example: figma vs. indesign (adobe). the reason figma wins is because it's a niche enough application domain independent of a larger ecosystem
