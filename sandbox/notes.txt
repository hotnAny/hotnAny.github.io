notes:

- you can use whichever
- show a slide that includes all the info
- encourage them to code (otherwise just thinking seems boring; coding keeps them more engaged)

- what explanation strategies/techniques did you use?
- if you were to do it again, how would you explain it differently?


00:05  intro
00:30  developing the recognizer (maybe as individuals)
00:15  think about explanation (only took 5min?)
- share your solution by explaining it
- what strategies/techniques did you use
00:10  present your explanation
